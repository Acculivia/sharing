I was not consulted about the cover. The book is mainly concerned

with the biological, psychological and philosophical significance of
<br>
virtual machinery. I did not know that the publishers had decided
<br>
to associate it with paper tape devices until it was published.

<blockquote>
Harvester Studies in Cognitive Science is a new series which will
explore the nature of knowledge by way of a distinctive theoretical
approach  one that takes account of the complex structures and
interacting processes that make thought and action possible.
Intelligence can be studied from the point of view of psychology,
philosophy, linguistics, pedagogy and artificial intelligence, and
all these different emphases will be represented within the series.

History of the online version of the book (2001 to 2015):
</b></h3>

This book, published in 1978 by Harvester Press (UK) and Humanities Press (USA),
has been out of print for many years. In 2001 Manuela Viezzer, photocopied the
book to A4 sheets while a PhD student here.

</div>
Sammy Snow, a departmental
administrator, scanned in the photocopy and produced the
original OCR version (in RTF, later converted to HTML).
<p>
The scanned copy unfortunately had many pencilled comments and corrections so
the files were very messy, but were eventually made readable. It
proved necessary to redo all the figures, using the TGIF package, freely
available for Linux and Unix, from:
<a href="http://bourbon.usc.edu/tgif/download.html">http://bourbon.usc.edu/tgif/download.html</a>
<br>
Chris Glur  reported portions of the text that
needed correction after scanning and conversion to html. It is likely that
errors still remain. Please report any to A.Sloman@cs.bham.ac.uk.
<p>
For a while, Ceinwen Cushway kindly made printed copies of the
new version available at a charge to cover printing and postage. The
<a href="crp.pdf">online PDF version</a> now makes this unnecessary.
The online version of CRP became available in September 2001, as separate html
chapters. Notes and corrections were added at various times, and the format
modified. Some of the changes are indicated in the text. The online edition
includes recently added notes and
comments, e.g. <a href="#chap9-notes">the notes at the end of Chapter 9</a> (on
vision).

<p>
<a name="download"></a>
PDF versions were first produced by reading html files into
OpenOffice, editing, then exporting to PDF. Since
about 2012 the PDF files have been created directly from html, using the
<font color="blue">superb</font>
<a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~jan/html2psug.html">html2ps</a>
package and ps2pdf (on linux).
An older PDF version (now out of date) is also available from
<a href="http://www.theassc.org/eprints_archive">the EPRINTS archive</a>
of
ASSC (The Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness).

In 2003, Michael Malien converted the html files (now out of date) to
<a href="http://www.techscribe.co.uk/techw/compiled_html.htm">CHM

In December 2014 I installed a copy of the 1981 Review of the book by Steven
Stich, and wrote a reply to the criticisms he (and others) had made of the
claim in Chapter 2 that explanations of <i>possibilities</i> are a core part of
science even if they are not falsifiable. More information about that review,
and my response to the criticisms can be found in a

<a name="philrelevance"></a>
<h3><b>
Philosophical relevance
</b></h3>
<div style="margin-left:15px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Some parts of the book are dated whereas others are still relevant both
to the scientific study of mind and to philosophical questions about
the aims of science, the nature of theories and explanations, varieties
of concept formation, and to questions about the nature of mind.
<p>
In particular,
<a href="#chap2">Chapter 2</a>
analyses the variety of scientific advances
ranging from shallow discoveries of new laws and correlations to deep
science which extends our ontology, i.e. our understanding of what is
possible, rather than just our understanding of what happens when.
<p>
Insofar as AI explores designs for possible mental mechanisms, possible
mental architectures, and possible minds using those mechanisms and
architectures, it is primarily a contribution to deep science, the science of
what is possible, in contrast with most empirical psychology which is shallow
science, exploring correlations: the science of laws and regularities. This
contrast is taken up further in the
<a href="crp-afterthoughts.html">Afterthoughts</a> document mentioned
<a href="#afterthoughts">above</a>, and in a separate
paper on explaining possibilities, developing and supporting the ideas in
<a href="#chap2">Chapter 2</a>:
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/explaining-possibilities.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/explaining-possibilities.html</a>
<p>
This "designer stance" approach to the study of mind was very different
from the "intentional stance" being developed by Daniel Dennett at the same
time, expounded in his 1978 book <I>Brainstorms</I>, and later
partly re-invented by Alan Newell as the study of "The knowledge Level"
(see his 1990 book <I>Unified Theories of Cognition</I>). Both Dennett
and Newell based their methodologies on a presumption of rationality,
whereas the designer-stance considers functionality, which is possible
without rationality, as insects and microbes demonstrate well,
Functional mechanisms may provide limited rationality, as Herb Simon
noted in his 1969 book <I>The Sciences of the Artificial</I>.
</div>
<p>
<hr>
<a name="airelevance"></a>
<h3><b>
Relevance to AI and Cognitive Science
</b></h3>
<div style="margin-left:15px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
In some ways the AI portions of the book are not as out of date as the
publication date might suggest because it recommends approaches that
have not yet been explored fully
(e.g. the study of human-like mental architectures in
<a href="#chap6">Chapter 6</a>) now being pursued by various research groups
associated with the Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architecture (BICA) society,
<a href="http://bicasociety.org/">http://bicasociety.org/</a>,
among others. Several of the research directions and some of the alternatives
that have been explored have not made huge amounts of progress (e.g. there has
been much vision research in directions that are different from those
recommended in <a href="#chap9">Chapter 9</a>). There has been a vast amount of
research in the use of statistical evidence either collected by a learning
machine or assembled by humans or human products and fed into training
processes. But I think the successes of such approaches are all narrowly bounded
by the data used, unlike humans (and possibly some other animals) whose learning
abilities include powers of extrapolation that seem to be based on generative
theories rather than data-mining. (This needs to be explained in more detail
elsewhere. Some of the work in progress on the Meta-morphogenesis project
mentioned <a href="#meta-morphogenesis">below</a>, is relevant.)

<p>
Ideas about "Representational Redescription" presented in Annette
Karmiloff-Smith's 1992 book <i>Beyond Modularity</i> summarised in her BBS 2004
article, are illustrated by my discussion of some of what goes on when a child
learns about numbers in <a href="#chap8">Chapter 8</a>. That chapter suggests
mechanisms and processes involved in learning about numbers that could be
important for developmental psychology, philosophy and AI, but have never been
properly developed. The chapter also emphasises the connections between cardinal
(and ordinal) numbers and one-one correspondences (recognised as essential to
the notion of number by Hume, Cantor, Frege, Russell and others). Understanding
the concept also requires grasping the transitivity and other properties of 1-1
correspondences. Many psychological studies of numerical cognition ignore that
requirement. Piaget was aware of it.
<p>

the book was published. I may add more such notes from time to time.

<div style="margin-left:15px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
A draft sequel to this book was partly written around 1985, but never
published because I was dissatisfied with many of the ideas, especially
because I did not think the notion of "computation" was well defined.
More recent work developing themes from the book is available in the
Cognition and Affect Project directory

A particularly relevant discussion note is my answer to the question 'what is
information?' -- in the context of the notion of an information-processing
system such as an animal or a human (not Shannon's notion of information):

which was supplemented by a contrast between Jane Austen's concept of
"information", used in her novels, and Claude Shannon's concept:

NOTE on educational predictions made in 1978
</b>
<div style="margin-left:15px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px;">
The world has changed a lot since the book was published in 1978, but not
enough, in one important respect.
<p>
In the Preface and in Chapter 1 comments were made about how the
invention of computing was analogous to the combination of the invention
of writing and of the printing press, and predictions were made about
the power of computing to transform our educational system to stretch
minds.
<p>
Alas the predictions have not yet come true: instead computers are used
in schools for lots of shallow activities. Instead of teaching cooking,
as used to happen in 'domestic science' courses we teaching them
'information cooking' using word processors, browsers, an the like. We
don't teach them to design, debug, test, analyse, explain new machines
and tools, merely to use existing ones as black  boxes. That's like
teaching cooking instead of teaching chemistry.
<p>
In 2004 a paper on that topic, accepted for a UK conference on grand
challenges in computing education referred back to the predictions in
the book and how the opportunities still remain. The paper, entitled
'Education Grand Challenge:
A New Kind of Liberal Education ---
Making People Want a Computing Education For Its Own Sake'
is
available in HTML and PDF formats here
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/misc/gc-ed.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/misc/gc-ed.html</a>
<br>
Additional comments were made in 2006 in this document
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/compedu.html">
Why Computing Education has Failed and How to Fix it</a>
<p>
In 2007 I attempted, unsuccessfully to generate interest in a multidisciplinary
school syllabus combining computing, biology, cognitive science and philosophy.

<b>Computing at School (Started in 2009)</b>
<br>
<a href="http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/">http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/</a>
<br>
Since 2009 the computing at school organisation has grown and become very
influential, helping to produce massive changes to UK computing education,
from primary school (age about 6) upwards, with far more emphasis on
designing, implementing and testing programs, and far less on merely using
computer-based tools. A Computing At School conference has been organised in the
School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham every Summer since
2009. Although this is bringing about massive broadening and deepening of the
computing education in UK schools, it is mainly focused on making
computers do things rather than trying to understand natural forms of
information processing by modelling them, including human competences such as
vision, use of language, learning, generating stories, etc. Perhaps that will
change as more school teachers become available with the required confidence,
insight and breadth of experience.

<h2><b>
PREFACE TO 1978 EDITION
<br>
(Slightly modified in 2001)
</b></h2>

<p>
Another book on how computers are going to change our
lives? Yes, but this is more about computing than about
computers, and it is more about how our thoughts may be
changed than about how housework and factory chores will
be taken over by a new breed of slaves.
<p>
Thoughts can be changed in many ways. The invention of
painting and drawing permitted new thoughts  in the processes of
creating and interpreting pictures. The invention of
speaking and writing also permitted profound extensions of
our abilities to think and communicate. Computing is a bit
like the invention of paper (a new medium of expression) and
the invention of writing (new symbolisms to be embedded in
the medium) combined. But the writing is more important
than the paper. And computing is more important than computers:
programming languages, computational theories and
concepts -- these are what computing is about, not transistors,
logic gates or flashing lights. Computers are pieces of machinery
which permit the development of computing as pencil
and paper permit the development of writing. In both
cases the physical form of the medium used is not very
important, provided that it can perform the required
functions.
<p>
Computing can change our ways of thinking about many
things, mathematics, biology, engineering, administrative procedures,
and many more. But my main concern is that it can
change our thinking about ourselves: giving us new models,
metaphors, and other thinking tools to aid our efforts to
fathom the mysteries of the human mind  and heart. The
new discipline of Artificial Intelligence is the branch of computing
most directly concerned with this revolution. By giving
us new, deeper, insights into some of our inner processes, it
changes our thinking about ourselves. It therefore changes
some of our inner processes, and so changes what we are, like
all social, technological and intellectual revolutions.
<p>
I cannot predict all these changes, and certainly shall not
try. The book is mainly about philosophical thinking, and its
transformation in the light of computing. But one of my
themes is that philosophy is not as limited an activity as you
might think. The boundaries between philosophy and other
theoretical and practical activities, notably education, software
engineering, therapy
and the scientific study of man, cannot be drawn as neatly as
academic syllabuses might suggest. This blurring of disciplinary
boundaries helps to substantiate a claim that a revolution
in philosophy is intimately bound up with a revolution in the
scientific study of man and its practical applications.
Methodological excursions into the nature of science and
philosophy therefore take up rather more of this book than I
would have liked. But the issues are generally misunderstood,
and I felt something needed to be done about that.
<p>
I think the revolution is also relevant to several branches of
science and engineering not directly concerned with the study
of man. Biology, for example, seems to be ripe for a computational
revolution. And I don't mean that biologists should
use computers to juggle numbers  -- number crunching is not
what this book is about. Nor is it what computing is essentially
about. Further, it may be useful to try to understand
the relationship between chemistry and physics by thinking
of physical structures as providing a computer on which
chemical programs are executed. But I am not so sure about
that one, and will not pursue it.

<p>
Though fascinated by the intellectual problems discussed
in the book, I would find it hard to justify spending public
money working on them if it were not for the possibility of
important consequences, including applications to education.
But perhaps I should not worry: so much public money is
wasted on futile research and teaching, to say nothing of
incompetent public administration, ridiculous defence
preparations, profits for manufacturers and purveyors of
shoddy, useless or harmful goods (like cigarettes), that a little
innocent academic study is marginal.

<p>
Early drafts of this book included lots of nasty comments
on the current state of philosophy, psychology, social science,
and education. I have tried to remove them or tone them
down, since many were based on my ignorance and prejudice.
In particular, my knowledge of psychology at the time of writing was
dominated by lectures, seminars, textbooks and journal articles from the
1960s. Nowadays many psychologists are as critical as I could
be of such psychology (which does not mean they will
agree with my criticisms and proposed remedies). And
Andreski's <i>Social Science as Sorcery</i> makes many of
my criticisms of social science redundant.
<p>
I expect I shall be treading on many toes in my
bridge-building comments. The fact that I have not read everything
relevant will no doubt lead me into howlers. Well, that's life.
Criticisms and corrections, published or private will be
welcomed. (Except for arguments about whether I am doing
philosophy or psychology or some kind of engineering.
Demarcation disputes are usually a waste of time. Instead
ask: are the problems interesting or important, and is some
real progress made towards dealing with them?)
<p>
Since the book is aimed at a wide variety of readers with
different backgrounds, it will be found by each of them to
vary in clarity and interest from section to section. One
person's banal oversimplification is another's mind-stretching
novelty. Partly for this reason, the different chapters vary
in style and overlap in content. The importance of the
topic, and the shortage of informed discussion seemed to
justify offering the book for publication despite its many
flaws.
<p>
One thing that will infuriate some readers is my refusal to
pay close attention to published arguments in the literature
about whether machines can think, or whether people are
machines of some sort. People who argue about this sort of
thing are usually ignorant of developments in artificial intelligence,
and their grasp of the real problems and possibilities
in designing intelligent machines is therefore inadequate.
Alternatively, they know about machines, but are ignorant of many old
philosophical problems for mechanist theories of mind.
<p>
Most of the discussions (on both sides) contain more prejudice and
rhetoric than analysis or argument. I think this is because in
the end there is not much scope for rational discussion on
this issue. It is ultimately an ethical question whether you
should treat robots like people, or at least like cats, dogs or
chimpanzees; not a question of fact. And that ethical question is the
real meat behind the question whether artefacts
could ever think or feel, at any rate when the question is
discussed without any attempt to actually <i>design</i> a thinking or
feeling machine.
<p>
When intelligent robots are made (with the help of philosophers),
in a few hundred or a
few thousand years time, some people will respond by accepting them as
communicants and friends, whereas others will
use all the old racialist arguments for depriving them of the
status of persons. Did you know that you were a racialist?
<p>
But perhaps when it comes to living and working with robots,
some people will be surprised how hard it is to retain the old
disbelief in their consciousness, just as people have been surprised
to find that someone of a different colour may actually
be good to relate to as a person. For an unusually informative
and well-informed statement of the racialist position concerning
machines see Weizenbaum 1976. I admire his book,
despite profound disagreements with it.
<p>
So, this book is an attempt to publicise an important, but
largely unnoticed, facet of the computer revolution: its
potential for transforming our ways of thinking about ourselves.
Perhaps it will lead someone else, knowledgeable about
developments in computing and Artificial Intelligence, to do
a better job, and substantiate my claim that within a few
years philosophers, psychologists, educationalists, psychiatrists, and
others will be professionally incompetent if
they are not well-informed about these developments.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
</b></h2>
<p>
I have not always attributed ideas or arguments derived from
others. I tend to remember content, not sources. Equally I'll
not mind if others use my ideas without acknowledgement.
The property-ethic dominates too much academic writing.
It will be obvious to some readers that besides recent work
in artificial intelligence the central ideas of Kant's
<i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> have had an enormous influence on this book.
Writings of Frege, Wittgenstein, Ryle, Austin, Popper, Chomsky, and
indirectly Piaget have also played an important role.
Many colleagues and students have helped me in a variety
of ways: by provoking me to disagreement, by discussing
issues with me, or by reading and commenting on earlier
drafts of one or more chapters. This has been going on for a
long time, so I am not sure that the following list includes
everyone who has refined or revised my ideas, or given me new ones:
<p>
Frank Birch, Margaret Boden, Mike Brady, Alan Bundy,
Max Clowes, Steve Draper, Gerald Gazdar, Roger Goodwin,
Steven Hardy, Pat Hayes, Geoffrey Hinton, Laurie Hollings,
Nechama Inbar, Robert Kowalski, John Krige, Tony Leggett,
Barbara Lloyd, Christopher Longuet-Higgins, Alan Mackworth,
Frank O'Gorman, David Owen, Richard Power, Julie
Rutkowska, Alison Sloman, Jim Stansfield, Robin Stanton,
Sylvia Weir, Alan White, Peter Williams.
<p>
Pru Heron, Jane Blackett, Judith Dennison, Maryanne
McGinn and Pat Norton helped with typing and editing. Jane
Blackett also helped with the diagrams.
<p>
The U.K. Science Research Council helped, first of all by
enabling me to visit the Department of Artificial Intelligence
in Edinburgh University for a year in 1972-3, and secondly
by providing me with equipment and research staff for a three
year project on computer vision at Sussex.
<p>
Bernard Meltzer was a very helpful host for my visit to Edinburgh, and several
members of the department kindly spent hours helping me learn programming, and
discussing computing concepts, especially Bob Boyer, J. Moore, Julian Davies and
Danny Bobrow. Steve Hardy and Frank O'Gorman continued my computing education
when I returned from Edinburgh. Several of my main themes concerning the status
of mind can be traced back to interactions with Stuart Sutherland (e.g. see his
1970) and Margaret Boden. Her book <i>Artificial Intelligence and Natural
Man,</i> like other things she has written, adopts a standpoint very similar to
mine, and we have been talking about these issues over many years. So I have
probably cribbed more from her than I know.
<p>
She also helped by encouraging me to put together various
privately circulated papers when I had despaired of being able
to produce a coherent, readable book. By writing her book
she removed the need for me to give a detailed survey of current work
in the field of A.I. Instead I urge readers to study
her survey to get a good overview.
<p>
I owe my conversion to Artificial Intelligence, towards the
end of 1969, to Max Clowes. I learnt a great deal by attending his
lectures for undergraduates. He first pointed out to
me that things I was trying to do in philosophical papers I
was writing were being done better in A.I., and urged me to
take up programming. I resisted for some time, arguing that
I should first finish various draft papers and a book. Fortunately, I
eventually realised that the best plan was to scrap
them.
<p>
(I have not been so successful at convincing others that
their intellectual investments are not as valuable as the new
ideas and techniques waiting to be learnt. I suspect, in some
cases, this is partly because they were allowed by the British
educational system to abandon scientific and mathematical
subjects and rigorous thinking at a fairly early age to specialise in
arts and humanities subjects. I believe that the
knowledge-explosion, and the needs of our complex modern
societies, make it essential that we completely re-think the
structure of formal education, from primary schools upwards:
indefinitely continued teaching and learning at all ages in
sciences, arts, humanities, crafts (including programming)
must be encouraged. Perhaps that will be the best way to
cope with unemployment produced by automation, and the
like. But I'm digressing!).

<p>
Alison, Benjamin and Jonathan tolerated (most of the
time) my withdrawal from family life for the sake of this
book and other work. I did not wish to have children, but as
will appear frequently in this book
(e.g., in
<a href="#chap8">the chapter on learning about numbers</a>),
observing them and interacting
with them has taught me a great deal. In return, my
excursions into artificial intelligence and the topics of the
book have changed my way of relating to children. I think I
now understand their problems better, and have acquired a
deeper respect for their intellectual powers.
<p>
The University of Sussex provided a fertile environment
for the development of the ideas reported here, by permitting
a small group of almost fanatical enthusiasts to set up a
'Cognitive Studies Programme' for interdisciplinary teaching
and research, and providing us with an excellent though
miniscule computing laboratory. But for the willingness of
the computer to sit up with me into the early hours helping
me edit, format, and print out draft chapters (and keeping
me warm when the heating was off), the book would not
have been ready for a long time to come.
<p>
I hope that, one day, even better computing facilities will
be commonplace in primary schools, for kids to play with.
After all, primary schools are more important than universities, aren't
they?
<p>
I should like to thank John Spiers of Harvester Press for tolerating my
tardiness in completing the book, and Gillian Orton for patiently preparing the
typescript for the printer.

<i>1.1.(Page 1) Computers as toys to stretch our minds</i>
</b>
<br>
Developments in science and technology are responsible for
some of the best and some of the worst features of our lives.
The computer is no exception. There are plenty of reasons
for being pessimistic about its effects in the short run, in a
society where the lust for power, profit, status and material
possessions are dominant motives, and where those with
knowledge -- for instance scientists, doctors and programmers
-- can so easily manipulate and mislead those without.
<p>
Nevertheless I am convinced that the ill effects of computers can
eventually be outweighed by their benefits. I am
not thinking of the obvious benefits, like liberation from
drudgery and the development of new kinds of information
services. Rather, I have in mind the role of the computer, and
the processes which run on it, as a new medium of self-expression,
perhaps comparable in importance to the invention of writing.
<p>
Think of it like this. From early childhood onwards we all
need to play with toys, be they bricks, dolls, construction
kits, paint and brushes, words, nursery rhymes, stories, pencil
and paper, mathematical problems, crossword puzzles, games
like chess, musical instruments, theatres, scientific laboratories,
scientific theories, or other people. We need to interact
with all these playthings and playmates in order to develop
our understanding of ourselves and our environment  that
is, in order to develop our concepts, our thinking strategies,
our means of expression and even our tastes, desires and aims
in life. The fruitfulness of such play depends in part on how
complex the toy and the processes it generates, and how rich
the interaction between player and toy are.
<p>
A modern digital computer is perhaps the most complex
toy ever created by man. It can also be as richly interactive as
a musical instrument. And it is certainly the most flexible:
the very same computer may simultaneously be helping an
eight year old child to generate pictures on a screen and helping a
professional programmer to understand the unexpected
behaviour of a very complex program he has designed. Meanwhile other
users may be attempting to create electronic
music, designing a program to translate English into French,
testing a program which analyses and describes pictures, or
simply treating the computer as an interactive diary. A few
old-fashioned scientists may even be doing some numerical
computations.
<p>
Unlike pet animals and other people (also rich, flexible and
interactive), computers are toys designed by people. So
people can understand how they work. Moreover the designs
of the programs which run on them can be and are being
extended by people, and this can go on indefinitely. As we
extend these designs, our ability to think and talk about
complex structures and processes is extended. We develop
new concepts, new languages, new ways of thinking. So we
acquire powerful new tools with which to try to understand
other complex systems which we have not designed, including
systems which have so far largely resisted our attempts at
comprehension: for instance human minds and social systems.
Despite the existence of university departments of psychology,
sociology, education, politics, anthropology, economics and
international relations, it is clear that understanding of these
domains is currently at a pathetically inadequate level: current
theories don't yet provide a basis for designing satisfactory
educational procedures, psychological therapies, or
government policies.
<p>
But apart from the professionals, ordinary people need
concepts, symbolisms, metaphors and models to help them
understand the world, and in particular to help them understand
themselves and other people. At present much of our
informal thinking about people uses unsatisfactory mechanistic models
and metaphors, which we are often not even
aware of using. For instance even people who strongly oppose
the application of computing metaphors to mental processes,
on the grounds that computers are mere mechanisms, often
unthinkingly use much cruder mechanistic metaphors, for
instance 'He needed to let off steam', I was pulled in two
directions at once, but the desire to help my family was
stronger', 'His thinking is stuck in a rut', 'The atmosphere in
the room was highly charged'. Opponents of the spread of
computational metaphors are in effect unwittingly condemning people to
go on living with hydraulic, clock-work, and
electrical metaphors derived from previous advances in
science and technology.
<p>
To summarise so far: it can be argued that computers, or,
to be more precise, combinations of computers and programs,
constitute profoundly important new toys which can give us
new means of expression and communication and help us
create an ever-increasing new stock of concepts and metaphors for
thinking about all sorts of complex systems, including ourselves.
<p>
I believe that not only psychology and social sciences but
also biology and even chemistry and physics can be transformed by
attempting to view complex processes as computational processes,
including rich information flow between
sub-processes and the construction and manipulating of symbolic
structures within processes. This should supersede older
paradigms, such as the paradigm which represents processes
in terms of equations or correlations between numerical variables.
<p>
This paradigm worked well for a while in physics but
now seems to dominate, and perhaps to strangle, other
disciplines for which it is irrelevant. Apart from computing
science, linguistics and logic seem to be the only sciences
which have sharply and successfully broken away from the
paradigm of 'variables, equations and correlations'. But perhaps it is
significant that the last two pretend not to be concerned with
processes, only with structures. This is a serious
limitation, as I shall try to show in later chapters.

1.2.(Page 3) The Revolution in Philosophy
</i></b>
<br>
Well, suppose it is true that developments in computing can
lead to major advances in the scientific study of man and
society: what have these scientific advances to do with
philosophy?
<p>
The very question presupposes a view of philosophy as
something separate from science, a view which I shall attempt
to challenge and undermine later, since it is based both on a
misconception of the aims and methods of science and on the
arrogant assumption by many philosophers that they are the
privileged guardians of a method of discovering important
non-empirical truths.
<p>
But there is a more direct answer to the question, which is
that very many of the problems and concepts discussed by
philosophers over the centuries have been concerned with
<i>processes,</i> whereas philosophers, like everybody else, have
been crippled in their thinking about processes by too limited
a collection of concepts and formalisms. Here are some
age-old philosophical problems explicitly or implicitly concerned
with processes. How can sensory experience provide a rational
basis for beliefs about physical objects? How can concepts be
acquired through experience, and what other methods of concept
formation are there? Are there rational procedures for
generating theories or hypotheses? What is the relation
between mind and body? How can non-empirical knowledge,
such as logical or mathematical knowledge, be acquired? How
can the utterance of a sentence relate to the world in such a
way as to say something true or false? How can a one-dimensional string
of words be understood as describing a
three-dimensional or multi-dimensional portion of the world?
What forms of rational inference are there? How can motives
generate decisions, intentions and actions? How do non-verbal
representations work? Are there rational procedures for
resolving social conflicts?
<p>
There are many more problems in all branches of philosophy concerned
with processes, such as perceiving, inferring,
remembering, recognising, understanding, learning, proving,
explaining, communicating, referring, describing, interpreting,
imagining, creating, deliberating, choosing, acting, testing,
verifying, and so on. Philosophers, like most scientists, have
an inadequate set of tools for theorising about such matters,
being restricted to something like common sense plus the
concepts of logic and physics. A few have clutched at more
recent technical developments, such as concepts from control
theory (e.g. feedback) and the mathematical theory of games
(e.g. payoff matrix), but these are hopelessly deficient for the
tasks of philosophy, just as they are for the task of psychology.
<p>
The new discipline of artificial intelligence explores ways
of enabling computers to do things which previously could be
done only by people and the higher mammals (like seeing
things, solving problems, making and testing plans, forming
hypotheses, proving theorems, and understanding English). It
is rapidly extending our ability to think about processes of
the kinds which are of interest to philosophy. So it is important for
philosophers to investigate whether these new ideas
can be used to clarify and perhaps helpfully reformulate old
philosophical problems, re-evaluate old philosophical theories,
and, above all, to construct important new answers to old
questions. As in any healthy discipline, this is bound to generate a
host of new problems, and maybe some of them can
be solved too.
<p>
I am prepared to go so far as to say that within a few years,
if there remain any philosophers who are not familiar with
some of the main developments in artificial intelligence, it
will be fair to accuse them of professional incompetence, and
that to teach courses in philosophy of mind, epistemology,
aesthetics, philosophy of science, philosophy of language,
ethics, metaphysics, and other main areas of philosophy, without
discussing the relevant aspects of artificial intelligence will
be as irresponsible as giving a degree course in physics which
includes no quantum theory. Later in this book I shall elucidate
some of the connections. Chapter 4, for example, will show how
concepts and techniques of philosophy are relevant to AI and cognitive
science.
<p>
Philosophy can make progress, despite appearances. Perhaps
in future the major advances will be made by people
who do not call themselves philosophers.
<p>
After that build-up you might expect a report on some of
the major achievements in artificial intelligence to follow. But
that is not the purpose of this book: an excellent survey can
be found in Margaret Boden's book. <i>Artificial Intelligence and Natural Man,</i> and other works mentioned in the
bibliography will take the interested reader into the depths of
particular problem areas. (Textbooks on AI will be especially
useful for readers wishing to get involved in <i>doing</i> artificial
intelligence.)
<p>
My main aim in this book is to re-interpret some age-old
philosophical problems, in the light of developments in computing.
These developments are also relevant to current issues
in psychology and education. Most of the topics are closely
related to frontier research in artificial intelligence, including
my own research into giving a computer visual experiences, and
analysing motivational and emotional processes in computational terms.
<p>
Some of the philosophical topics in Part One of the book
are included not only because I think I have learnt important
things by relating them to computational ideas, but also
because I think misconceptions about them are among the
obstacles preventing philosophers from accepting the relevance of
computing. Similar misconceptions may confuse workers in AI and
cognitive science about the nature of their discipline.
<p>
For instance, the chapters on the aims of science and the relations
between science and philosophy attempt to undermine the wide-spread
assumption that philosophers are doing something so different from
scientists that they need not bother with scientific developments
and <i>vice versa</i>.
Those chapters are also based on the idea that developments in
science and philosophy form a computational process not
unlike the one we call human learning.
<p>
The remaining chapters, in Part Two, contain attempts to
use computational ideas in discussing some problems in metaphysics,
philosophy of mind, epistemology, philosophy of
language and philosophy of mathematics. I believe that further
analysis of the nature of number concepts and arithmetical knowledge
in terms of symbol-manipulating processes
could lead to profound developments in primary school
teaching, as well as solving old problems in philosophy of
mathematics.
<p>
In the remainder of this chapter I shall attempt to present,
in bold outline, some of the main themes of the computer
revolution, followed by a brief definition of
``Artificial Intelligence''. This will help to set the stage for what
follows. Some of the themes will be developed in detail in later
chapters.
Others will simply have to be taken for granted as far as this
book is concerned. Margaret Boden's book and more recent
textbooks on AI fill most of the gaps.
<p>
<a name="1.3."></a>
<b><i>
1.3.(Page 6) Themes from the Computer Revolution
</i></b>
<br>
1. Computers are commonly viewed as elaborate numerical
calculators or at best as devices for blindly storing and
retrieving information or blindly following sequences of
instructions programmed into them. However, they can be
more accurately viewed as an extension of human means of
expression and communication, comparable in importance
to the invention of writing. Programs running on a computer
provide us with a medium for thinking new thoughts, trying
them out, and gradually extending, deepening and clarifying
them. This is because, when suitably programmed, computers
are devices for constructing, manipulating, analysing, interpreting
and transforming symbolic structures of all kinds,
including their own programs.
<p>
2. Concepts of 'cause', law', and 'mechanism', discussed
by philosophers, and used by scientists, are seriously impoverished by
comparison with the newly emerging concepts.
<p>
The old concepts suffice for relatively simple physical mechanisms,
like clocks, typewriters, steam engines and unprogrammed computers,
whose limitations can be illustrated by
their inability to support a notion of <i>purpose.</i>
<p>
By contrast, a
programmed computer may include representations of itself,
its actions, possible futures, reasons for choosing, and
methods of inference, and can therefore sometimes contain
purposes which generate behaviour, as opposed to merely
containing physical structures and processes which generate
behaviour. So biologists and psychologists who aim to banish
talk of purposes from science, thereby ignore
some of the most important new developments in science.
So do philosophers and psychologists who use the existence
of purposive human behaviour to 'disprove' the possibility of
a scientific study of man.
<p>
3. Learning that a computer contains a certain sub-program
enables you to explain some of the things it can do, but provides no
basis for predicting what it <i>always</i> or
<i>frequently</i>
does, since that will depend on a large number of other factors which
determine when this sub-program is executed and
the environment in which it is executed. So a scientific investigation
of computational processes need not be primarily a
search for <i>laws</i> so much as an attempt to describe and explain
what sorts of things are and are not <i>possible.</i> A central form
of question in science and philosophy is 'How is so and so
possible?' Many scientists, especially those studying people
and social systems, mislead themselves and their students into
thinking that science is essentially a search for laws and
correlations, so that they overlook the study of possibilities.
Linguists (especially since Chomsky)
have grasped this point, however. (This
topic is developed at length in chapter 2.)
<p>
4. Similarly there is a wide-spread myth that the scientific
study of complex systems requires the use of numerical
measurements, equations, calculus, and the other mathematical
paraphernalia of physics. These things are useless for
describing or explaining the important aspects of the behaviour of
complex programs (e.g. a computer, operating system,
or Winograd's program described in his book
<i>Understanding Natural Language</i>).
<p>
Instead of equations and the like, quite new non-numerical
formalisms have evolved in the form of programming languages, along
with a host of informal concepts relating the
languages, the programs expressed therein, and the processes
they generate. Many of these concepts (e.g. <i>parsing, compiling,
interpreting, pointer, mutual recursion, side-effect, pattern matching)</i>
are very general, and it is quite likely that they
could be of much more use to students of biology, psychology
and social science than the kinds of numerical mathematics
they are normally taught, which are of limited use for theorising
about complex interacting structures. Unfortunately
although many scientists dimly grasp this point (e.g. when
they compare the DNA molecule with a computer program)
they are often unable to <i>use</i> the relationship: their conception
of a computer program is limited to
the sorts of data-processing programs written in low-level
languages like Fortran or Basic.
<p>
5. It is important to distinguish cybernetics and so-called
'systems theory' from this broader science of computation,
for the former are mostly concerned with processes involving
relatively fixed structures in which something quantifiable
(e.g. money, energy, electric current, the total population of
a species) flows between or characterises substructures. Their
formalisms and theories are too simple to say anything precise about
the communication of a sentence, plan or problem,
or to represent the process of construction or modification of
a symbolic structure which stores information or abilities.
<p>
Similarly, the mathematical theory of information, of
Shannon and Weaver, is mostly irrelevant, although computer programs
are often said to be information-processing mechanisms.
The use of the word 'information' in the mathematical theory
has proved to be utterly misleading. It is not concerned with
meaning or content or sense or connotation or denotation,
but with probability and redundancy in signals. If more suitable
terminology had been chosen, then perhaps a horde of
artists, composers, linguists, anthropologists, and even philosophers
would not have been misled.
<p>
I am not denying the importance of the theory to electronic engineering
and physics. In some contexts it is useful to think of communication as
sending a signal down a noisy line, and understanding as involving some
process of decoding signals. But human communication is quite different:
we do not decode, we interpret, using enormous amounts of background
knowledge and problem-solving abilities. That is, we map one class of
structures (e.g. 2-D images), into another class (e.g. 3-D scenes).
Chapter 9 elaborates on this, in describing work in computer vision. The
same is true of artificial intelligence programs which understand
language. Information theory is not concerned with such mappings.
<p>
6. One of the major new insights is that computational
processes may be markedly decoupled from the physical processes of the
underlying computer. Computers with quite
different basic components and architecture may be equivalent in an
important sense: a program which runs on one of
them can be made to run on any other either by means of a
second program which simulates the first computer on the
second, or by means of a suitable compiler or interpreter program
which <i>translates</i> the first program into a formalism
which the second computer can execute. So a program  may run on a
<I>virtual</I> machine.
<p>
Differences in size can be got round by attaching peripheral storage
devices such as magnetic discs or tapes, leaving only differences in
speed.
<p>
So all modern digital computers are theoretically equivalent,
and the detailed physical structure and properties of a computer need
not constrain or determine the symbol-manipulating and problem-solving
processes which can run on it: any
constraints, except for speed, can be overcome by providing
more storage and feeding in new programs. Similarly, the programs do
not determine the computers on which they can run.
<p>
7. Thus reductionism is refuted. For instance, if biological
processes are computational processes running on a physico-chemical
computer, then essentially the same processes could,
with suitable re-programming, run on a different sort of computer.
Equally, the same computer could permit quite different computations:
so the nature of the physical world need
not determine biological processes. Just as the electronic
engineers who build and maintain a computer may be quite
unable to describe or understand some of the programs which
run on it, so may physicists and chemists lack the resources
to describe, explain or predict biological processes. Similarly
psychology need not be reducible to physiology, nor social
processes to psychological ones. To say that wholes may be
more than the sum of their parts, and that qualitatively new
processes may 'emerge' from old ones, now becomes an
acceptable part of the science of computation, rather than
old-fashioned mysticism. Many anti-reductionists have had
this thought prior to the development of computing, but
have been unable to give it a clear and indisputable foundation.
<p>
8. There need not be only <i>two</i> layers: programs and physical
machine. A suitably programmed computer (e.g. a computer with a
compiler program in it[2]), is itself a new computer  a new
'virtual machine'  which in turn may be
programmed so as to support new kinds of processes. Thus a
single process may involve many layers of computations, each
using the next lower layer as its underlying machine.
But that is not all. The relations may sometimes not even
be hierarchically organised, for instance if process A forms
part of the underlying machine for process B and process B
forms part of the underlying machine for process A. Social
and psychological, psychological and physiological processes,
seem to be related in this mutually supportive way. Chapters
6 and 9 present some examples. The development of good
tools for thinking about a system composed of multiple interlocking
processes is only just beginning. Systems of differential equations
and the other tools of mathematical physics
are worse than useless, for the attempt to use them can yield
quite distorted descriptions of processes involving intelligent systems,
and encourage us to ask unfruitful questions.
<p>
9. Philosophers sometimes claim that it is the business of
philosophy only to analyse concepts, not to criticise them.
But constructive criticism is often needed and in many cases
the task will not be performed if philosophers shirk it. An
important new task for philosophers is constructively critical
analysis of the concepts and underlying presuppositions
emerging from computer science and especially artificial
intelligence. Further, by carefully analysing the mismatch
between some of our very complicated ordinary concepts
like <i>goal, decide, infer, perceive, emotion, believe, understand,</i>
and the models being developed in artificial intelligence,
philosophers may help to counteract unproductive exaggerated
claims and pave the way for further developments. They will
be rewarded by being helped with some of their philosophical
problems.
<p>
10. For example, the computational metaphor, paradoxically, provides
support for a claim that human decisions are
not physically or physiologically determined, since, as
explained above, if the mind is a computational process using
the brain as a computer then it follows that the brain does
not constrain the range of mental processes, any more than a
computer constrains the set of algorithms that can run on it.
It can be more illuminating to think of the program (or mind) as
constraining the physical processes than vice versa.
<p>
Moreover, since the state of a computation can be frozen, and
stored in some non-material medium such as a radio signal
transmitted to a distant planet, and then restarted on a different
computer, we see that the hitherto non-scientific hypothesis that
people can survive bodily death, and be resurrected
later on, acquires a new lease of life. Not that this version is
likely to please theologians, since it no longer requires a god.
<p>
11. Recent attempts to give computers perceptual abilities
seem to have settled the empiricist/rationalist debate by
supporting Immanuel Kant's claim that no experiencing is
possible without information-processing (analysis, comparison,
interpretation of data) and that no information-processing is
possible without pre-existing knowledge in the form of
symbol-manipulating procedures, data-structures, and quite
specific descriptive abilities. (This topic is elaborated in chapter
9.)
<p>
Shallow philosophical, linguistic and psychological disputes about
innate or non-empirical knowledge are being
replaced by much harder and deeper explorations of exactly
what pre-existing knowledge is required, or sufficient, for
particular types of empirical and non-empirical learning. What
knowledge of two- and three-dimensional geometry and of
physics does a robot need in order to be able to interpret its
visual images in terms of tables, chairs and dishes to be carried
to the sink? What kind of knowledge about its own symbolisms and
symbol-manipulating procedures will a baby robot
need in order to stumble upon and understand the discovery
that counting a row of buttons from left to right necessarily
produces the same result as counting from right to left, if no
mistakes occur? (More on this sort of thing in the chapter on
learning about numbers.)
<p>
Similarly, philosophical debates about the possibility of
'synthetic apriori' knowledge dissolve in the light of new insights
into the enormous variety of ways in which a computational system
(including a human society?) may make
inferences, and perhaps discover necessary truths about the
capabilities and limitations of its current stock of programs.
For an example see the book by Sussman about a program
which learns to build better programs for stacking blocks
by analysing why initial versions go wrong.
<br>
(G.J. Sussman,
<I>A Computational Model of Skill Acquisition,</I>
American Elsevier, 1975.)
<p>
Epistemology, developmental psychology, and the history of
ideas (including science and art) may be integrated in a single
computational framework. The chapters on the aims of
science and on number concepts are intended as a small step
in this direction.
<p>
12. One of the bigger obstacles to progress in science and
philosophy is often our inability to tell when we lack an
explanation of something. Before Newton, people thought
they understood why unsupported objects fell. Similarly, we
think practice explains learning, familiarity explains recognition,
desire explains action. Philosophers often assume that
if you have experienced instances and non-instances of some
concept, then this 'ostensive definition' suffices to explain
how you could have learnt this concept. So our experience of
seeing blue things and straight lines is supposed to explain
how we acquire the concepts <i>blue</i> and <i>straight.</i> As for
<i>how</i>
the relevant aspects of instances and non-instances are
noticed, related to one another and to previous experiences,
and how the irrelevant aspects are left out of consideration
the question isn't even asked. (Winston asked it, and gave
some answers to it in the form of a primitive learning program: see his
1975.) Psychologists don't normally ask these questions
either: having been indoctrinated with the paradigm of
dependent and independent variables, they fail to distinguish
a study of the <i>circumstances</i> in which some behaviour does
and does not occur, from a search for an <i>explanation</i> of that
behaviour.
<p>
People assume that if a person or animal wants something,
then this, together with relevant beliefs, suffices to explain
the resulting actions. But no decent theory is offered to
explain <i>how</i> desires and beliefs are capable of generating
action, and in particular no theory of how an individual finds
relevant beliefs in his huge store of information, or how conflicting
motives enter into the process, or how beliefs, purposes, skills, etc.
are combined in the design of an action (e.g.
an utterance) suited to the current situation. The closest
thing to a theory in the minds of most people is the model of
desires as physical forces pushing us in different directions,
with the strongest force winning. The mathematical theory of
games and decisions is a first crude attempt to improve on
this, but is based on the false assumptions that people start
with a well-defined set of alternative actions when they take
decisions.
<p>
Work in artificial intelligence on programs which
formulate and execute plans is beginning to unravel some of
the intricacies of such processes.
My chapter on aspects of the mechanism of mind will discuss some of
the problems. (Chapter 6).
<p>
By trying to turn our explanations and theories into
designs for working systems, we soon discover their poverty.
The computer, unlike academic colleagues, is not convinced
by fine prose, impressive looking diagrams or jargon, or even
mathematical equations. If your theory doesn't work then
the <i>behaviour</i> of the system you have designed will soon
reveal the need for improvement. Often errors in your design will
prevent it behaving at all.
<p>
Books don't behave. We have long needed a medium for expressing theories
about behaving systems. Now we have one, and a few years of
programming explorations can resolve or clarify some issues
which have survived centuries of disputation.
<p>
Progress in philosophy (and psychology) will now come from those who
take seriously the attempt to <i>design a person.</i>
I propose a new criterion for evaluating philosophical writings: could
they help someone designing a mind, a language, a society or a world?
<p>
The same criterion is relevant to theorising in psychology.
The difference is that philosophy is not so much concerned
with finding the correct explanation of <i>actual</i> human
behaviour. Its aims are more general. For more
on the difference see chapters 2 and 3.
<p>
13. A frequently repeated discovery, using the new methodology, is
that what seemed simple and easy to explain turns out to be
very complex, requiring sophisticated computational resources, for
instance: seeing a dot, remembering a word,
learning from an example, improving through practice, recognising a
familiar shape, associating two ideas, picking up a
pencil. Of course, it may be that for all these achievements
there are simple explanations, of kinds hitherto quite unknown. But at
least we have learnt that we don't know them,
and that is real progress. This also teaches a new respect for
the intellects of infants and other animals. How does a bee
manage to alight on a flower without crashing into it?
<p>
14. There are some interesting implications of the points
made in 7 and 8 above. I mentioned that two computational
processes may be mutually supportive. Similarly, two procedures may
contain each other as parts, two information
structures may contain each other as parts. More generally, a
whole system may be built up from large numbers of
<i>mutually recursive</i> procedures and data-structures, which interlock
so tightly that no element can be properly defined except in
terms of the whole system. (Recursive rules in formal grammars
illustrate the same idea.) Since the system cannot be
broken down hierarchically into parts, then parts of those
parts, until relatively simple concepts and facts are reached,
it follows that anyone learning about the system has to learn
many different interrelated things in parallel, tolerating confusion,
oversimplifications, inaccuracies, and constantly
altering what has previously been learnt in the light of what
comes later.[3]
<p>
So the process of <i>learning</i> a complex interlocking network
of circular concepts, theories and procedures may have much
in common with the task of <i>designing</i> one.
<p>
If all this is correct it not only undermines philosophical
attempts to perform a logical analysis of our concepts in
terms of ever more primitive ones (as Wittgenstein, for
example, assumed possible in his
<i>Tractatus Logico Philosophicus)</i>, it also has profound
implications for the psychology of learning and for educational
practice. It seems to imply
that learning may be a highly creative process, that cumulative
educational programmes may be misguided, and that
teachers should not expect pupils to get things right while
they are in the midst of learning a collection of mutually
recursive concepts. This theme will be illustrated in more
detail in the chapter on learning about numbers.
<p>
(One implication is that this book cannot be written in
such a way as to introduce readers to the main ideas one at a
time in a clear and accurate way. Readers who are new to the
system of concepts will have to revisit different portions of
the book frequently. No author has the right to expect this.
The book is therefore quite likely to fail to communicate.)
<p>
15. Much of what is said in this book simply reports <i>common sense.</i>
That is, it attempts to articulate much of the
sound intuitive knowledge we have picked up over years of
interacting with the physical world and with other people.
<p>
Making common sense explicit is the goal of much philosophising.
Common sense should not be confused with <i>common opinions,</i>
namely the beliefs we can readily formulate when asked: these are often false
over-generalisations or merely the result of prejudice. Common sense is a rich
and profound store of information, not about laws, but about what people are
capable of doing, thinking or experiencing.
<p>
But common sense, like our knowledge of the grammar of
our native language, is hard to get at and articulate, which is
one reason why so much of philosophy, psychology and
social science is vapid, or simply false.
<p>
Philosophers have been struggling for centuries to develop
techniques for articulating common sense and unacknowledged
presuppositions, such as the techniques of conceptual
analysis and the exploration of paradoxes. Artificial
intelligence provides an important new tool for doing this. It helps
us find our mistakes quickly. One reason for this is that
attempts to make computers understand what we say soon
break down if we haven't learnt to articulate in the programs
the presuppositions and rich conceptual structures which we
use in understanding such things. (See Abelson, 'The structure
of belief systems', and Schank &amp; Abelson, 1977.)
<p>
Further, when you've designed a program whose behaviour
is meant to exemplify some familiar concept, such as learning,
perceiving, conversing, or achieving a goal, then in trying to
interact with the program and in experiencing its behaviour it
often happens that you come to realise that it does not really
exemplify your concept after all, and this may help you to
pin down features of the concept, essential to its use, which
you had not previously noticed. So artificial intelligence contributes
to conceptual analysis. (The interaction is two-way.)
<p>
16. Of course, merely <i>imagining</i> the program's behaviour
would often suffice: running the program isn't necessary in
principle. But one of the sad and yet exhilarating facts most
programmers soon learn is that it is hard to be sufficiently
imaginative to anticipate the kinds of behaviour one's
program can produce, especially when it is a complex system
capable of generating millions of different kinds of processes
depending on what you do with it. It is a myth that programs
do just what the programmer intended them to do, especially
when they are interacting with compilers, operating systems
and hardware designed by someone else. The result is often
behaviour that nobody planned and nobody can understand.
<p>
Thus new possibilities are discovered. Such discoveries may
serve the same role as thought-experiments have often done
in physics. So computational experiments may help to extend
common sense as well as helping us to analyse it.
<p>
17. One of the things I have been trying to do is undermine
the conflict between those who claim that a scientific study
of man is possible and those who claim it isn't. Both sides are
usually adopting a quite mistaken view of the essence of
science. Bad philosophical ideas seem to have a habit of pervading a
whole culture (like the supposed dichotomy between
the emotional, intuitive aspects of people and the cognitive,
intellectual, or rational aspects -- a dichotomy I have tried to
undermine elsewhere).
<p>
The chapter on the aims of science attempts to correct widespread but
mistaken views about the nature of science. I first became aware of the
mistakes under the influence of linguistics and artificial intelligence.
<p>
18. One of the main themes of the revolution is that the
pure scientist needs to behave like an engineer: designing and
testing <i>working</i> theories. The more complex the processes
studied, the closer the two must become. Pure and applied
science merge. And philosophers need to join in.
<p>
19. I'll end with one more wildly speculative remark.
Social systems are among the most complex computational
processes created by man (whether intentionally or not).
Most of the people currently charged with designing, maintaining,
improving or even studying such processes are almost
completely ignorant of the concepts, and untrained in the
skills, required for thinking about very complex interacting
processes. Instead they mess about with <i>variables</i> (on ordinal,
interval or ratio scales), looking for <i>correlations</i> between
them, convinced that <i>measurement</i> and <i>laws</i> are the stuff of
science, without recognizing that such techniques are merely
useful stop-gaps for dealing with phenomena you don't yet
understand. In years to come, our willingness to trust these
politicians, civil servants, economists, educationalists and the
like with the task of managing our social system will look
rather laughable. I am not suggesting that programmers should
govern us. Rather, I venture to suggest that if everyone were
allowed to play with computers from childhood, not only
would education become much more fun and stretch our
minds much further, but people might be a lot better
equipped to face many of the tasks which currently defeat us
because we don't know how to think about them. Computer
'experts' would find it harder to exploit us.

1.4.(Page 17) What is Artificial Intelligence?
</i>
</b>
<p>
The best way to answer this question is to look at the aims of
A.I., and some of the methods for achieving those aims, and
to show how the subject is decomposable into sub-domains
and related to other disciplines. This would require a whole
book, which is not my current purpose. So I'll give an incomplete
answer by describing and commenting on some of the aims. AI is not just
the attempt to make machines do things which when done by people are
called ``intelligent''. It is much broader and deeper than this. For it
includes the scientific and philosophical aims of <I>understanding</I>
as well as the engineering aim of <I>making</I>.
<p>
<p>
<b>
The aims of Artificial Intelligence
</b>
<p>
<b>1.</b> <b>Theoretical</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>possible</b>
<b>effective</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b>
<b>intelligent</b> <b>behaviour.</b>
<br>
<b>2.</b> <b>Explaining</b> <b>human</b> <b>abilities.</b>
<br>
<b>3.</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>intelligent</b> <b>artefacts.</b>
<p>
<b>Comments on the aims:</b>
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The first aim is very close to the aims of Philosophy. The
main difference is the requirement that explanations be
'effective'. That is they should form part of, or be capable
of contributing usefully to the design of, a working system, i.e. one
which generates the behaviour to be
explained.
<p>
<li>The second aim is often formulated, by people working in
A.I., as the aim of designing machines which 'simulate'
human behaviour, i.e. behave like people. There are many
problems about this, e.g. which people?  People differ
enormously. Also what does 'like' mean here? Programs,
mechanisms, and people may be compared at many different levels.
<p>
<li>The programming of computers is not an essential part of the first two
aims: rather it is a research method. It imposes a discipline, and
provides a tool for finding out what your explanations are theoretically
capable of explaining.
Sometimes they can do more than you intended  usually
less.

<p>
<li>People doing A.I. do not usually bother much about
experiments or surveys of the kinds psychologists and
social scientists do, because the main current need is not
for more <i>data</i> but for better theories and theory-building
concepts and formalisms, so that we can begin to explain
the masses of data we already have. (In fact a typical
strategy for getting theory-building off the ground, in A.I.
as in other sciences, is to try to explain idealised and simplified
situations, in which much of the available data are
ignored: e.g. A.I. programs concerned with 'toy' worlds
(like the world of overlapping letters described in chapter
9), and physicists treating moving objects as point masses.)

<p>
<li>An issue which bothers psychologists is how we can tell
whether a particular program really does explain some
human ability, as opposed to merely mimicking it. The
short answer is that there is never any way of establishing
that a scientific explanation is correct. However, it is
possible to compare rival explanations, and to tell whether
we are making progress. Criteria for doing this are formulated in
chapter 2.
<p>
<li>The notion of 'intelligent behaviour' in the first aim is
easy to illustrate but hard to define. It includes behaviour
based on the ability to cope in a systematic fashion with
a range of problems of varying structures, and the ability
(consciously or unconsciously) to build, describe, interpret, compare,
modify and use complex structures, including symbolic structures like
sentences, pictures, maps and
plans for action.
A.I. is not specially concerned with unusual or meritorious
forms of intelligence: ordinary human beings and other
animals display the kinds of intelligence whose possibility
A.I. seeks to explain.
<p>
<li>It turns out that there is not just one thing called
'intelligence', but an enormous variety of kinds of expertise
the ability to see various kinds of things, the ability to
understand a language, the ability to learn different kinds
of things, the ability to make plans, to test plans, to solve
problems, to monitor our actions, etc. It also includes the
ability to have motives, emotions, and attitudes, e.g. to
feel lonely, embarrassed, proud, disgusted, elated, and so
on. Each of these abilities involves domain-specific knowledge
(factual and procedural  knowing that and knowing
how). So, much current work in A.I. is exploration of the
<i>knowledge</i> underlying competence in a variety of specialised
domains  seeing blocks, understanding children's
stories, making plans for building things out of blocks,
assembling bits of machinery, reading handwriting, synthesising or
checking computer programs, solving puzzles,
playing chess and other games, solving geometrical problems, proving
logical and mathematical theorems, etc.
<p>
I.e. a great deal of A.I. research is highly  'domain-specific', and
amounts to an attempt to explicitly formulate knowledge people already
use unconsciously in ordinary life or specialised activities. This is
closely related to conceptual analysis as practised by linguists and
philosophers.
(See Chapter 4.)
<p>
<li>Alongside all this, there is the search for generality. So
research is in progress on possible computing mechanisms
and concepts which are not necessarily relevant only to
one domain, but may be useful, or necessary, for explaining many
different varieties of intelligence, e.g. mechanisms concerned with
good ways of storing and retrieving
information, making inferences, controlling processes,
allowing sub-processes to interact and influence one
another, allowing factual knowledge to be translated into
procedural forms as required, etc. However, the role of
general mechanisms seems to be much less important in
explaining intelligent abilities than the role of domain specific
knowledge.
<p>
<li>As pointed out below, much of the domain-specific
research overlaps with research in other disciplines, e.g.
Linguistics, Psychology, Education, Philosophy, Anthropology, and
perhaps Physiology. For example, you can't
make a computer understand English without studying
syntactic, semantic and pragmatic rules of English, that is,
without doing Linguistics.
<p>
<li>A major effect of A.I. research as already mentioned is to
establish that apparently simple tasks, like seeing a line,
may involve very complex cognitive processes, using substantial prior
knowledge.
<p>
<li>One side-effect of attempts to understand human abilities
well enough to give them to computers, has been the
introduction of some new approaches to teaching those
abilities to children, for instance LOGO projects (see
papers by Papert). These projects use a programming
language based on programming languages developed for
A.I. research, and they teach children and other beginners
programming using such a language. These languages are
much more suitable for teaching beginners than BASIC or
FORTRAN, the most commonly used languages, because
(a) they are very much more powerful, making it relatively
easy to get the computer to do complex things and (b)
they are not restricted to numerical computations. For
example, LOGO, used at MIT and Edinburgh University,
and POP-2, which we use at Sussex University, provide
facilities suitable for manipulating words and sentences,
drawing pictures, etc. (See Burstall et al. 1971.)

<p>
<li>A.I. gives people much more respect for the achievements
of children, and more insight into the problems they have
to solve in learning what they do. This leads to a better
understanding of possible reasons for not learning so well.
</ol>

<i>1.5.(Page 20) Conclusion</i>
</b>
<br>
The primary aim of my research is to understand aspects of
the human mind. Different people will be interested in
different aspects, and many will not be interested in the aspects I
have chosen: scientific creativity, decision making, visual perception,
the use of verbal and non-verbal symbolisms, and
learning of elementary mathematics. At present I can only
report fragmentary progress. Whether it is called philosophy,
psychology, computing science, or anything else doesn't
really interest me. The methods of all these disciplines are
needed if progress is to be made.
It may be that the human mind is too complex to be
understood by the human mind. But the desire to attempt
the impossible seems to be one of its persistent features.
<p>
<b>Note</b>
<br>
The remaining chapters, apart from chapter 10 should be
readable in any order. On the whole, people knowledgeable about
philosophy and ignorant of computing will
probably find chapters 2 to 5 easier than the following
chapters. People interested in trying to understand how
people work, and not so concerned with abstract methodological issues,
may find chapters 2 to 5 tedious (or difficult?), and should
start with Part Two, though they'll not be able to follow
all the methodological asides, which refer back to earlier
chapters.

(1) I write 'program' not 'programme' since the former is a technical
term referring to a collection of definitions, instructions and
information expressed in a precise language capable of being interpreted by
a computer. For more details see J. Weizenbaum,
<i>Computer Power and Human Reason.</i>
There is much in this book that I disagree with, but it is well worth
reading, and may be a useful antidote to some of my excesses.
<p>
(2) A compiler is a program which translates programs from one programming
language into another. E.g. an ALGOL compiler may translate
ALGOL programs into the 'machine code' of a particular computer.
<p>
(3) Apparently Hegel anticipated some of these ideas. His admirers
might advance their understanding of his problems by turning to the
study of computation.

2.1. Part One: Overview
</b></h3>
<a name="2.1.1."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.1.1. Introduction
</I>
</b></h3>
Very many persons and institutions are engaged in what they
call scientific research. Do their activities have anything in
common? They seem to ask very different sorts of questions,
about very different sorts of objects, events and processes,
and they use very different methods for finding answers.
<p>
If we ask scientists what science is and what its aims are,
we get a confusing variety of answers.
<p>
Whom should we believe? Do scientists really know what
they are doing, or are they perhaps as confused about their
aims and methods as the rest of us? I suggest that it is as hard
for a scientist to characterise the aims and methods of science
in general as it is for normal persons to characterise the
grammatical rules governing their own use of language. But I
am going to stick my neck out and try.
<p>
If we are to understand the nature of science, we must see
it as an activity and achievement of the human mind
alongside others, such as the achievements of children in learning
to talk and to cope with people and other objects in their
environment, and the achievements of non-scientists living in
a rich and complex world which constantly poses problems
to be solved. Looking at scientific knowledge as one form of
human knowledge, scientific understanding as one form of
human understanding, scientific investigation as one form of
human problem-solving activity, we can begin to see more
clearly what science is, and also what kind of mechanism the
human mind is.
<p>
I suggest that no <i>simple</i> slogan or definition, such as can
be found in textbooks of science or philosophy can capture
its aims. For instance, I shall try to show that it is grossly
misleading to characterise science as a search for laws. Science
is a complex network of different interlocking activities with
multiple practical and theoretical aims and a great variety of
methods. I shall try to describe some of the aims and their
relationships. Oversimple characterisations, by both scientists
and philosophers, have led to unnecessary and crippling
restrictions on the activities of some would-be scientists,
especially in the social and behavioural sciences, and to
harmfully rigid barriers between science and philosophy.
<p>
By undermining the slogan that science is the search for
laws, and subsidiary slogans such as that quantification is
essential, that scientific theories must be empirically refutable,
and that the methods of philosophers cannot <i>serve</i> the aims
of scientists, I shall try to liberate some scientists from the
dogmas indoctrinated in universities and colleges. I shall also
try in later chapters to show philosophers how they can
contribute to the scientific study of man, thereby escaping from
the barrenness and triviality complained of so often by
non-philosophers and philosophy students.
<p>
An important reason for studying the aims and methods of
science is that it may give us insights into the learning processes
of children, and help us design machines which can learn.
Equally, the latter project should help us understand science.
A side-effect of my argument is to undermine some old
philosophical distinctions and pour cold water on battles
which rage around them  like the distinction between
subjectivity and objectivity, the distinction between science and
philosophy and the battles between empiricists and rationalists.
<p>
My views have been powerfully influenced by the writings
of Karl Popper.
However, several major points of disagreement with him will emerge.
<p>
<a name="2.1.2."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.1.2. First crude subdivision of aims of science
</I>
</b></h3>
Science has not just one aim but several. The aims of scientific
investigation can be crudely subdivided as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>To extend man's knowledge and understanding of the
form and contents of the universe (<I>factual aims</I>),
<p>
<li>To extend man's control over the universe, and to use
this to improve the world (<I>technological or practical
aims</I>),
<p>
<li>To discover how things ought to be, what sorts of
things are good or bad and how
best to further the
purposes of nature or (in the case of religious scientists) God
(<I>normative aims</I>).
</ol>
<p>
Whether the third aim makes sense (and many scientists and
philosophers would dispute this) depends on whether it is
possible to derive values and norms from facts. I shall not discuss
it as it is not relevant to the main purposes of this book.
The second kind of aim will not be given much attention
either, except when relevant to discussions of the first kind
of aim, on which I shall concentrate.
<p>
These aims are not restricted to science. We all, including
infants and children, aim to extend our knowledge and
understanding: science is unique only in the degree of rigour,
system and co-operation between individuals involved in its
methods. For the present, however, I shall not explore the
<i>peculiarities</i> of science, since what it has in <i>common</i> with
other forms of acquisition of knowledge has been too long
neglected, and it is the common features I want to describe.
<p>
In particular, notice that one cannot have the aim of
<i>extending</i> one's knowledge unless one presupposes that one's
knowledge is incomplete, or perhaps even includes mistakes.
This means that pursuing science requires systematic
self-criticism in order to find the gaps and errors.
This distinguishes both science and perhaps the curiosity of young
children from some other belief systems, such as dogmatic
theological systems and political ideologies. (See chapter 6
for the role of self-criticism in intelligence.) But it does not
distinguish science from philosophy. Let us now examine the
factual aims of science more.closely.
<p>
<a name="2.1.3."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.1.3. A further subdivision of the factual aims: form and content
</I>
</b></h3>
The aims of extending knowledge and understanding can be
subdivided as follows:
<DL Compact>
<DT>(1.a) Extending knowledge of the form of the world:<DD>Extending
knowledge of what sorts of things are
possible and impossible in the world, and how or why
they are (the aim of interpreting the world, or learning
about its <i>form).</i> (This will be further subdivided
below.)
<blockquote>
<small>
NOTE: I would now (since about 2002) express
the aim of 'extending knowledge of what
sorts of things are possible' in terms of 'extending the ontology' we
use. This is also part of the process of child development, e.g. as
illustrated in this presentation:
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cosy/papers/#pr0604">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cosy/papers/#pr0604</a>
<br>
'Ontology extension' in evolution and in development, in animals and machines.
<p>
And in:
        <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/talks/#glang">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/talks/#glang</a>
<br>
Evolution of minds and languages.
<br>
What evolved first and develops first in children:
<br>
Languages for communicating, or languages for thinking
(Generalised Languages: GLs)?
</small>
</blockquote>
<p>
<DT>(l.b) Extending knowledge of the contents of the world:<DD>Extending
knowledge of what particular objects,
events, processes, or states of affairs exist or existed
in particular places at particular times (the aim of
acquiring 'historical' knowledge, or learning about
the <i>contents</i> of the world).
</DL>
<p>
A similar distinction pervades the writings of Karl Popper,
though he would disagree with some of the things I say below
about (1.a). Different branches of science tend to stress one
or other of these aims, though both aims are usually present
to some extent. For instance, physics is more concerned with
aim (1.a), studying the form of the world, whereas
astronomy is perhaps more concerned with
(1.b), studying the contents.
<p>
Geology, geography, biology, anthropology, human
history, sociology, and some kinds of linguistics tend to be
more concerned with (1.b), i.e. with learning about the
particular contents of particular parts of the universe.
Chemistry,
some branches of biology, economics and psychology
attempt to investigate truths not so restricted in scope. In the
jargon of philosophers, (1.a) is concerned with universals,
(l.b) with particulars.
<p>
However, the two scientific aims are very closely linked.
One cannot discover what sorts of things are <i>possible,</i> nor test
explanatory theories, except by discovering particular facts
about what <i>actually</i> exists or occurs. Conversely, one cannot
really understand <i>particular</i> objects, events, processes, etc.,
except insofar as one classifies and explains them in the light
of more general knowledge about what <i>kinds</i> of things there
can be and how or why. These two aims are closely linked in
all forms of learning about the world, not only in science.
The study of form and the study of content go hand in hand.
(This must be an important factor in the design of intelligent
machines.)
<p>
I have characterised these aims in a <i>dynamic</i>
form: the aim
is to extend knowledge, to go on learning. Some might say
that the aim is to arrive at some terminal state when everything
is known about the form and content of the world, or
at least the form. There are serious problems about whether
this suggestion makes sense: for example how could one tell
that this goal had been reached? But I do not wish to pursue
the matter. For the present, it is sufficient to note that it
makes sense to talk of extending knowledge, that is removing
errors and filling gaps, whether or not any final state of
complete knowledge is possible. Some of the criteria for deciding
what is an extension or improvement will be mentioned later.
<p>
Many philosophers of science have found it hard to explain
the sense in which science makes progress, or is cumulative.
(E.g. Kuhn (1962), last chapter.) This is because they tend to
think of science as being mainly concerned with laws; and
supposed laws are constantly being refuted or replaced by
others. Very little seems to survive. But if we see science as
being also concerned with knowledge of what is possible, then
it is obviously cumulative. For a single instance demonstrates
a new possibility and, unlike a law, this cannot be refuted by
new occurrences, even if the possibility is re-described from
time to time as the language of scientists evolves.
<p>
Hypotheses about the <i>limits</i> of possibilities (laws) lack this
security, for they are constantly subject to revision as the
boundaries are pushed further out, by newly discovered (or
created) possibilities. Explanations of possibilities and their
limits frequently need to be refined or replaced, for the same
reason. But this is all a necessary part of the process of learning and understanding more about what is possible in the
world. (This is true of child development too.) It is an
organic, principled growth.
Let us now look more closely at aim (1.a), the aim of
extending knowledge of <i>the form</i> of the world.
<p>
<a name="2.2."></a>
<h3><b>
2.2. Part Two: Interpreting the world
</b></h3>
<a name="2.2.1."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.2.1. The interpretative aims of science subdivided
</I>
</b></h3>
The aim (l.a) of interpreting the world, or learning about its
form, can be subdivided into several subgoals listed below.
They are all closely related. To call some of them 'scientific'
and others 'metaphysical' or 'philosophical', as empiricists
and Popperians tend to do, is to ignore their inter-dependence.
Rather, they are all aspects of the attempt to discover what is
and what is not possible in the world and to understand why.
<p>
All the following types of learning will ultimately have to be catered
for in intelligent machines.
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Development of
<I>new concepts and symbolisms</I>
making it
possible to conceive of, represent, think about and ask
questions about new kinds or ranges of possibilities (e.g.
new kinds of physical substances, events, processes,
animals, mental states, human behaviour, languages, social
systems, etc.). This aim includes the construction of taxonomies,
typologies, scales of measurement and notations
for structural descriptions of chemical compounds or
sentences, or processes. This extension of our conceptual
and symbolic powers is one of the major functions of
mathematics in science. A major boost has recently come
from computing studies.
<p>
<li>Extending knowledge of what kinds of things (including
events and processes) <i>are possible in the world',</i> i.e. what
kinds of things are not merely conceivable or representable
<i>but really can exist or occur.</i>
Finding our what
actually exists, and trying to make new things exist, are
often means to this end. We can distinguish knowledge of
absolute possibility concerning a phenomenon X (X can
exist) from knowledge of relative possibility (X can exist
in conditions C). Extending knowledge of relative possibilities
for X is an important way of extending knowledge
of what is possible. All this should be distinguished from
(e) below, the goal of finding out what kinds of things are
most likely, common or frequent, either absolutely or in
specified conditions. The latter is a concern with
<i>probabilities</i> not <i>possibilities.</i> Subgoal (b) clearly
presupposes (a), for one can only acknowledge possibilities that one
can conceive of, describe or represent.
<p>
<li>Constructing <i>theories to explain known possibilities:</i> i.e.
theories about the underlying structures, mechanisms, and
processes capable of generating such possibilities. For
instance, a theory of the constituents of atoms may
explain the possibility of chemical elements with different
properties. Generative grammars are offered by linguists
as explanations of how it is possible for us to understand
an indefinitely large set of sentences. 'How is this possible?' is the typical form of a request for this kind of
explanatory theory, and should be contrasted with the
question 'Why is this so?' or 'Why is this impossible?', discussed in (f), below. Artificial intelligence models provide
a major new species of explanations of possibilities. E.g.,
they explain the possibility of various kinds of mental
processes, including learning, perceiving, solving problems,
and understanding language. Clearly (c) presupposes (b),
and therefore (a).
<p>
<li>Finding limitations on combinations of known possibilities.
These are often called laws of nature: for instance to say
that it is a law of nature that all X's are Y's is to say that
it is <i>impossible</i> for something to be both an X and not a
Y. It is these laws, limitations or impossibilities which
make the world relatively stable and predictable. This
goal, like (c), presupposes (b), since one can only discover
limitations of possibilities if one already knows about
those possibilities. (This subgoal of science is the one
most commonly stressed in the writings of scientists and
philosophers. It subsumes the goal of discovering causal
connections, since 'X causes Y' means, roughly 'the
occurrence of X makes the non-occurrence of Y impossible.')

<p>
<li>Finding
<i>regular or statistical correlations</i>
between different possibilities, for instance correlations of the form In
conditions C, 90% of all X's are Y's'. This is a search for
probabilities. It presupposes (b) for the same reason as
(d) does. Except in quantum physics, the search for such
statistical correlations is really only a stopgap or means
towards acquiring a deeper understanding of the sort
described in (d), above. Alternatively, it may be an aim of
a historical science: facts about relative frequencies and
proportions of various kinds of objects, events or processes
are often important facts about the <i>contents</i> of a
particular part of the world. For instance, most of the
correlations unearthed by social scientists are
culture-relative. Such information may have practical value
despite its theoretical poverty.
<p>
<li>Constructing <i>theories to explain known impossibilities, laws and correlations.</i> Such theories answer 'Why?'
questions, and are generally refinements of the theories
described in (c). That is, explaining limits of possibilities
(i.e. explaining laws) presupposes or refines an explanation of
the possibilities limited. The theory of
molecules composed of atoms which can recombine explains
the <i>possibility</i> of chemical change. Further refinements
concerning weights and valencies of atoms explain the
observed <i>limitations:</i> the laws of constant and multiple
proportions.
<p>
<li>Detecting and eliminating inadequate concepts, symbolisms,
beliefs about what is and is not possible, and
inadequate explanations of possibilities and laws. That this is
a subgoal of science is, as already remarked, implied by
saying that an aim of science is to <i>extend</i> knowledge. As
many philosophers of science have pointed out, it is not
generally possible to <i>prove</i> explanatory theories in science;
at most they can only be refuted or shown to be inadequate in some way.
Moreover, when several candidates
survive refutation, the most that can be done is to compare their
relative merits and faults, without necessarily
establishing the absolute superiority of one over the other.
It is often assumed that the only kinds of proper tests are
empirical (i.e. observations of new facts, in experiments
or in nature). However, we shall see that many important
tests are not empirical.
</ol>
<p>
If forced to summarise all this in a single slogan, one could
say:
<I>
A major aim of science is to
find out what sorts of things
are and are not possible in
the world, and to explain how
and why.</I>
<p>
A similar aim must motivate intelligent learning machines.
<p>
Though too short to be clear, this may be a useful antidote to
more common slogans stressing the discovery and explanation
of laws and regularities. Such slogans lead to an excessive
concern with prediction, control and testing, topics mainly
relevant to subgoals (d) to (g), while insufficient attention is
paid to the more fundamental aims (a) to (c), especially in
psychology and social science. The result is often
misguided research, theorising and teaching.
<p>
I shall say more about these three fundamental aims later.
The next two sections contain further general discussion of
the relations between these seven interpretative aims, and the
previously mentioned historical and technological aims of
science.
<p>
<a name="2.2.2."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.2.2. More on the interpretative and historical aims of science
</I>
</b></h3>
Unlike the historical scientist, the interpretative scientist is
interested in actual objects, events or situations only insofar
as they are <i>specimens</i> of <i>what is possible.</i> The
research chemist is not interested in the fact that <i>this</i> particular sample of
water was, on a certain day, decomposed into hydrogen and
oxygen in <i>that</i> laboratory, except insofar as this illustrates
something universal, such as the <i>possibility</i> of decomposing
water.
<p>
This possibility refutes the theory that water is a chemical
element and corroborates the alternative hypothesis that all
water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen, and also more
general theories about possible kinds of transformations of
matter. Similarly, although an 'historical' biologist may be
interested in recording, for a fascinated public, the flora and
fauna of a foreign isle, or the antics of a particularly intelligent
chimpanzee, the 'interpretative' biologist is interested
only insofar as they illustrate something, such as what <i>kinds</i>
of plants and animals can exist (or can exist in certain
conditions), or what <i>kinds</i> of behaviour are possible for a
chimpanzee, or for some other class containing the animal in
question.
<p>
In short, the interpretative scientist studies <i>the form</i> of the
world, using the <i>contents</i> only as evidence, whereas the
historical scientist simply studies the contents.
There is no reason why any one science, or scientist, should
be classified entirely as interpretative, or entirely as historical.
Different elements may intermingle in one branch of science.
For instance, a linguist studying a particular dialect is an
interpretative scientist insofar as he is not concerned merely
to record the actual set of sentences uttered by certain
speakers of that dialect, but to characterise the full range of
sentences that <i>would</i> or <i>could</i> be intelligible to an ordinary
speaker of that dialect, namely, a range of possibilities.
<p>
However, insofar as he is interested merely in finding out exactly
what dialect is intelligible to a certain spatio-temporally
restricted group of persons, he is an historical linguist, as
contrasted with a linguist who is interested in this dialect
primarily as a <i>sample</i> of the kinds of language which human
societies <i>can</i> develop: the attempt to characterise this set of
possible languages is often called the search for linguistic
universals.
<p>
Thus a richer terminology would be required for a precise
description of hybrid historical and interpretative aims. This
is not relevant to our present concerns and will not be pursued
further.
<p>
Like the interpretative aim, the "historical" aim of finding out about
the contents of particular bits of the world must also be built into
intelligent machines. Moreover, the pursuit of these
two aims by a machine will interact, as in science.

<h3><b>
<I>
2.2.3. Interpreting the world and changing it
</I>
</b></h3>
It is often said that the utility of science is to be explained in
terms of the discovery of laws and regularities with predictive
content. This is how the factual aims (1) subserve the
technological aims (2), distinguished previously. For instance, a law
which states that whenever A occurs, in situations of type S,
B will occur, can be used not only to explain and predict
particular occurrences of B, but also as a basis for making B
occur, if either of A or S occurs and one can make the other
occur. Similarly, knowledge of laws may provide a basis for
<i>preventing</i> unwanted events. This pragmatic value of laws is
not here disputed. However, the discovery, representation,
and explanation of absolute or relative <i>possibilities</i> is also of
great practical importance, even in cases where it is not
known how to predict, produce or prevent their realisation.
<p>
For example, knowing that rain is possible and wanting to
stay dry, one can take a waterproof covering whenever one
goes out. More generally, one can take precautions to prevent
the effects of an unwanted possibility, even if one cannot
predict or prevent it.
<p>
Similarly, one can take steps to get the best out of
possibilities one knows about but cannot predict or produce, like
building tanks to catch water in case it rains, which might be
worth doing even if one had no idea how often rain fell,
provided one needed the water enough and had time and
materials to spare.
<p>
The discovery of possibilities may have technological
significance in less direct ways. Knowing that something is
possible can provide a boost to research into an
understanding of how and why, so that its occurrence may be predicted
or brought about, or new variants produced. Knowledge that
it was possible for things heavier than air to fly, namely birds,
provoked research into ways of enabling men and machines
to do so. That was a case of a possibility demonstrated by
actual instances, then extended to a wider range of instances.
<p>
Sometimes a possibility is explained by a theory before
instances are known, and this again can have great
technological importance, as in the case of Einstein's discovery of
the possibility of converting mass into kinetic energy, or the
theoretical discovery of the possibility of lasers before they
were made. Much of engineering design consists of
demonstrating that some new phenomenon is possible and showing
how, or that some possibility can be produced in new ways
or in new conditions.
An intelligent planning system may also need to be able to generate
types of possibility before instances are known actually to exist.
This is commonplace in engineering design.
<p>

Formally this technological activity has much in common
with the supposedly purer or more theoretical activity of
inventing a new theory to explain some previously known
possibility, or using the ideas of one science to explain
possibilities observed in another, for instance using physics to
explain chemical possibilities, and using chemistry to explain
the very complicated possibility of sexual reproduction. (See
J. Watson, 1968.)
'Pure' science first discovers instances of possibilities then
creates explanations of those possibilities whereas 'applied'
science uses explanations of possibilities to create instances.
The kinds of creativity and modes of reasoning involved are
often similar.
More generally, any form of intelligent action requires an
understanding of possibilities. One cannot change the world
sensibly without first interpreting it, even though attempting
to change things is often indispensable for correcting
mistaken interpretations and deepening one's understanding.
Acting intelligently in a situation requires a survey of
possibilities, which requires an understanding of the potential for
change in the situation. For example, opening a window
requires a grasp of the possibilities for movement in the
window and its catch. But this requires interpreting what is
actual, i.e. relating it to general knowledge of what sorts of
things are possible in what circumstances: so action requires
knowledge of the form of the world. Grasping new
possibilities often involves inventing new concepts, new languages
in which to represent them, a topic discussed later.
<p>
Much more could be said about relations between the
interpretative aims of science, and the historical and
technological aims. Instead, let's take a closer look at some of the
interpretative aims of science, the aims concerned with
learning about and understanding possibilities. We shall attempt to
clarify the similarities and differences between these aims,
and then proceed to formulate criteria for assessing some of
the achievements of scientists.

<p>
<a name="2.3."></a>
<h3><b>
2.3. Part Three: Elucidation of subgoal (a)
</b></h3>
<a name="2.3.1."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.3.1. More on the interpretative aims of science
</I>
</b></h3>
Earlier I distinguished factual aims of science from
technological and normative aims, then divided factual aims into
interpretative and historical aims. The interpretative aims
were further subdivided into seven components, of which the
first three were:
<ol type="a">
<li>Developing new concepts and symbolisms making it
possible to conceive of, think about and ask questions
about new types of possibility;
<p>
<li>Extending knowledge of what kinds of things really
are possible, and not merely conceivable;
<p>
<li>Constructing explanations of how such things are
possible.
</ol>
<p>
The three aims are very tightly interconnected. It is very
hard to describe the distinctions between them accurately,
and I am sure I do not yet understand these matters aright.
Moreover, each of them could be further subdivided. Detailed
historical analysis is required here, so that similarities and
differences between cases can be described accurately and a
more satisfactory typology developed: a contribution to the
scientific study of science. Alas, this will require the help of
persons more scholarly than I. Let's take a closer look at (a).

<p>
<a name="2.3.2."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.3.2. The role of concepts and symbolisms
</I>
</b></h3>
Individuals (and cultural groups) can differ not only in the
things they know or believe, but also in the possibilities they
can grasp, the concepts they use, the generative power of
their language, the questions they can ask.
<p>
As new concepts and symbolisms are developed, and the
language extended, new questions become askable. For
instance, people who grasp the concepts 'hotter' and longer'
can understand the question whether metal rods get longer
when they are made hotter. And they may even be able to
grasp crude distinctions between metals according to which
grows longer <i>faster</i> when heated. But in order to learn to
think about whether the change in length is <i>proportional</i> to
the change in temperature, so that they can then use the
constant of proportionality (divided by the length of the rod)
to define a numerical 'coefficient of expansion' for each
metal, they need to grasp numerical representation of
differences in temperature and length ('hotter by how much?',
longer by how much?').
<p>
Similarly, although people may have a crude grasp of
distinctions between velocity and acceleration, and be able to
detect gross changes in either, on the basis of their own
experiences of moving things, being moved, and perceiving moving
objects, nevertheless, until they have learnt how to relate
concepts of distance and time to numerical interval scales, they
cannot easily make precise distinctions between different
velocities, or between acceleration and rate of change of
acceleration, nor think of precise relations between these concepts.
These familiar examples show the power of extending
scientific language by introducing numerical concepts and
notations corresponding to old non-numerical concepts. This
sort of thing has been so important in physics that many have been
deluded into thinking it
part of the definition of a scientist that he uses numbers!
<p>
The replacement of Roman numerals with the Arabic
system is an example of a powerful notational advance. Another
was the Cartesian method of using arithmetic to represent
geometry and vice versa. Both involved numbers.
<p>
<a name="2.3.3."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.3.3. Non numerical concepts and symbolisms
</I>
</b></h3>
<i>Non-numerical</i> conceptual and notational devices have also
been important. Examples are concepts used in describing
structures of plants and animals, concepts used for describing
structures of mechanical systems and electrical circuits
(geometrical and topological concepts), taxonomies or typologies,
and grammatical concepts (see N. Chomsky (1957).)
Non-numerical computing concepts and formalisms are the newest
example.
<p>
All sorts of notations besides numerical and algebraic
ones have played an important role in extending the abilities
of scientists to express what they know and want to find out.
<p>
Pictures, diagrams, maps, models, graphs, flow charts, and
computer programs, have all been used. Examples include:
the diagrams used in the study of levers, pulleys, bending
beams, and other mechanical systems; the 'pictures' of
molecules used by chemists, for instance, in the following
representation of the formation of water from hydrogen and
oxygen
<p>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>
          (H-H, H-H, 0=0) -----> (H-O-H, H-O-H)
</pre></b>
</font>
<p>
circuit diagrams used in electronics; optical drawings showing
the paths of light rays; plates showing tracks of subatomic
particles; and the 'trees' used by linguists to represent
structures or sentences. I shall argue later that these non-verbal
forms of representation play a part in valid reasoning,
scientific and non-scientific, conscious and unconscious.
<p>
<a name="2.3.4."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.3.4. Unverbalised concepts
</I>
</b></h3>
Concepts may also be used without being represented
explicitly by any external symbol. There are philosophers
who dispute that these are cases of the use of concepts, but
in the face of well known facts I can only regard this as
verbal quibbling. We know that young children and other
animals can discriminate, recognise and react intelligently to
things which they cannot name or describe. The consistency,
creativity and appropriateness of their behaviour shows that
they act on the basis of reasons, even if they cannot articulate
them or are unaware of them.
<p>
The same is true of an adult who cannot describe the
features of musical compositions which enable him to
recognise styles of composers and appreciate their music, or the
cues which enable him to judge another's mood. Non-logicians
can often distinguish valid from invalid arguments without
being able to say how. They have not learnt the overt language
of logicians.
<p>
No doubt this is true also of many scientists, especially
when they are in the early phases of some kind of conceptual
development. They may then, like children and chimpanzees,
be unable to articulate fully the reasons they have for some
of the decisions they take about interpreting evidence and
assessing hypotheses.
<p>
Even after going a stage further and learning how to
articulate their reasons, scientists may not yet have learned how to
<i>teach</i> their new concepts to colleagues and rival theorists. So
attempts at rational persuasion break down. This has misled
some philosophers and historians of science (e.g. Kuhn) into
thinking that there are no reasons, and inferring that the
decisions of scientists are irrational or non-rational. This is as
silly as assuming that a mathematician is irrational simply
because he cannot explain a theorem to a four year old child.
The child may have much to learn before he can understand
the problem, let alone the reasoning, and the mathematician
may be a poor teacher.
<p>
Concepts are not simple things which you either grasp or
don't grasp, or which can be completely conveyed by an
explicit definition or axiomatic characterisation. For instance,
as work of Piaget has shown so clearly, and Wittgenstein less
clearly, very many of our familiar concepts, like 'number',
'more', 'cause', 'moral' and language', are very complex
structures of which different fragments may be grasped at
different times. In a later chapter I shall illustrate this by
analysing some of the complexities children master when
they learn to count.
<p>

<a name="2.3.5."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.3.5. The power of explicit symbolisation
</I>
</b></h3>
The more of one's concepts and associated procedures one is
able to represent explicitly in symbols of some sort, the
greater one's power to explore possibilities systematically by
manipulating those symbols. For instance, by explicitly
characterising aspects of our intuitive grasp of spatial
structures in the form of axioms and definitions, one becomes
able to experiment with alterations in the axioms and
definitions, and thereby invent concepts of non-euclidean or
other new sorts of geometries.
This kind of "reflective abstraction" should play a role
in learning machines one day.
<p>
In this way one can learn to think about new sorts of
possibilities without waiting to be confronted with them. (This
kind of thing may also happen below the level of
consciousness, in children and scientists, as part of the process of
learning and discovery.) Of course, one may also extrapolate too
far, and construct representations of things which are not
<i>really</i> possible in the world, so empirical investigation of some
sort is required to discover whether things which are
conceivable or representable can also exist. For instance, merely
analysing the concept of an element with atomic number 325
will not decide whether such a thing can occur.
This is the reason for distinguishing the first aim of
interpretative science, namely extending concepts and symbolisms,
from the second aim, namely extending knowledge of what is
really possible.
<p>
<a name="2.3.6."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.3.6. Two phases in knowledge-acquisition: understanding and knowing
</I>
</b></h3>
It is not always noted in epistemological discussions that
there are two important phases or steps in the acquisition of
knowledge. Discovering that p is true first of all requires the
ability to understand the possibility that p might be true and
might be false, which requires grasping the concepts used in
the proposition p. The second phase is finding out that p is
true, for instance by empirical observation, use of testimony,
inference from what is already known, or some combination
of these. In the first phase one is able to ask a question, in
the second one has an answer. (There may be primitive kinds
of knowledge-acquisition, in people and other animals, in
which questions are never understood, only information
acquired and used. But science is not like this.)
<p>
Usually philosophers plunge into discussions of such
questions as whether we can know anything about the future, or
rationally believe anything about the future, without first
asking how a rational being can even <i>think</i> about the future or
<i>think</i> about alternative possible future states of affairs. (Work
in artificial intelligence is beginning to explore these problems.)
<p>
Philosophers are therefore attempting to assess the
rationality of certain decisions on the basis of a drastically
incomplete account of the resources that might enter into the
decision-making process. The reason why a study of our
ability to think of things has been shirked is partly because it
is so hard to do, partly because of an unwarranted restriction
of rationality to relations between evidence and
belief-contents, and partly because many philosophers think that
the investigation of conceptual mechanisms is a task for
psychologists not philosophers.
However, most psychologists never even think of the
important questions, and those who do usually lack the
techniques of conceptual analysis required for tackling them: so
the job does not get done. (Piaget seems to be an exception.)
<p>
There is a need for a tremendous amount of research into
what it is to understand various sorts of concepts, and what
makes it possible. There is also a need for some kind of
taxonomy of types of conceptual change, whether in individuals
or in cultures.
<p>
<a name="2.3.7."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.3.7. Examples of conceptual change
</I>
</b></h3>
Here are some examples of possibilities of conceptual change
which still require adequate explanations:

<ul>
<li>The child's
invention of a new procedure for using his existing counting
procedures in order to answer questions of the form 'What
number comes before N?'.
<blockquote>
<b>Note added 12 Jul 2017:</b>
<br>
This example is used in several places in this book, e.g. in
<a href="#chap6">Chapter 6</a> (on architectures for intelligent systems)
and
<a href="#chap8">Chapter 8</a> (on learning about numbers).
</blockquote>

<li>Going from being able to use
numbers in counting procedures to being able to use numbers as
<i>objects</i> which can themselves be counted, sorted, etc.

<li>Going
from being able to use the decimal representation of integers
greater than 9 to
<I>understanding the principles</I>
on which it
is
based.

<li>Grasping that a procedure so far used on small sets can
be extended indefinitely  like counting or matching.

<li>Going
from being able to apply some procedure to objects to
thinking of the result as a <i>property</i> of the object.

<li>Going from
grasping a relation like 'hotter' or longer' to grasping that it
can be used to define equivalence classes of objects of the
same temperature or length.

<li>Going from this to grasping the
possibility of comparing <i>differences</i> in temperature or length
(i.e. understanding an interval scale).

<li>Going from grasping
some general concept defined in terms of a structure, or a
function, or some combination of structure and function, to
grasping systematic principles for subdividing that concept
into different categories.

<li>Learning to separate the structural
and functional aspects of a hybrid concept, like 'knife', or
'experiment'.

<li>Changing a concept by changing the theories in
which it is embedded, in the way that the concept of mass
was changed by going from Newtonian mechanics to Einstein's
mechanics.

<li>Developing a more powerful symbolism for an old
set of concepts: e.g. inventing differential calculus notation
for representing changes, inventing co-ordinate representations
of geometrical concepts, inventing the use of variables to
express generality as in logic or mathematics, or using the
concept of a mathematical function to generalise earlier
concepts of regularity or correlation.

<li>Making explicit the
principles previously used implicitly in applying a set of concepts
as Einstein did for some old concepts of spatial and temporal
relations.

<li>Coming to see something in common between
things one has never previously classified together, like mass
and energy, particles and waves, straight lines and geodesics
on a sphere.

<li>Going from knowing a set of formulae and how
to manipulate them to being able to see their relevance to a
variety of new concrete problems e.g. going from
understanding algebra to being able to apply it in real life.

<li>Grasping a
relation between an abstract body of mathematics, and a set
of unsolved scientific problems.

<li>Learning to use the concept
of 'recursion' in logic, grammar, or programming.
</ul>
<p>
Until these and other conceptual changes are better
understood, discussion of 'incommensurability' of scientific theories
and of the role of rationality in science is premature.
Meanwhile education will continue to be largely a hit and miss
affair, with teachers not knowing what they are doing or how
it works,
When we really can model conceptual development, things will be very
different.

<p>
To sum up so far. We have been discussing subgoal (a), namely
<I>developing new concepts and symbolisms making it
possible to conceive of, think about and ask questions
about new types of possibility</I>
A
system of concepts and symbols with procedures for using
them constitutes a language. A language which is used to
formulate one theory, will usually also contain resources for
formulating alternatives, including the negation of the theory
and versions of the theory in which some predicate, relational
expression or numerical constant is replaced by another.
<p>
So concepts and symbols are tools for <i>generating</i> possibilities or
questions for investigation. They have greater generative
power than theories. The scientist who usefully extends the
<i>language</i> of science, unlike one who simply proposes a new
<i>theory</i> using existing concepts and symbols, extends the
hypothesis-forming powers of the scientists who understand
him. In this sense conceptual advances are more profound.
<p>
So the important differences between modern scientists
and those of the distant past include not merely the
statements and theories thought to be true or false, but also which
statements and theories could be thought of at all. Not only
are more answers known now, but more questions are
intelligible. The same applies to development of an individual.

<p>
<a name="2.3.8."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.3.8. Criticising conceptual systems
</I>
</b></h3>
Sometimes old questions become unaskable as a result of
conceptual change, like questions about phlogiston or absolute
velocity, or perhaps 'medical' questions like 'What did he do
to deserve this affliction?' Modern medical science contains
no means of generating possibilities constituting answers to
this question, though both laymen and some medical men
(on Sundays?) may still formulate them. (Incompatible
systems of concepts and theories may coexist in one mind  but
that's another story.)
<p>
So science is served not only by extending and
differentiating existing concepts: rejection of a concept or typology or
mode of representation may also serve the aims of science by
reducing the variety of dead-end questions and theories. Concepts,
typologies, taxonomies, and symbolisms can, like
theories, be rationally criticised, and rejected or modified.
Any intelligent learning system will need to have procedures
for rationally criticising its current conceptual and symbolic
resources. (See Winston (1975) for a simple example of a
computer program that modifies its own concepts.)
<p>
There are several ways in which a typology and associated
notation can be rationally criticised. For instance one may be
able to make one or more of these criticisms:
<p>
<blockquote>
(a) That there are some possibilities it doesn't allow for,
<p>
(b) That it represents as possible some cases which are not
<i>really</i> possible,
<p>
(c) That some of the subdivisions it makes are of no
theoretical importance,
<p>
(d) That some category within it should be subdivided
into two or more categories, because their instances
have different relations to the other categories,
<p>
(e) That a principle of subdivision fails to decide all
known cases, e.g. because of inapplicable tests,
<p>
(f) That the classification procedure generates inconsistent
classifications for some instances,
<p>
(g) That the notation used does not adequately reflect the
structural properties of the typology, or of the
instances, e.g. when people use diagrams with bogus
detail,
<p>
(h) That the concepts used generate questions which
apparently cannot be answered by empirical
investigation (like the question 'How fast is the Earth
moving through the aether?'),
<p>
(i) That more powerful explanatory theories can be
developed using other tools for representing
possibilities.
</blockquote>
<p>
I suspect that some or all of these criteria are used,
unconsciously of course, not only by scientists, but also by young
children in developing their conceptual systems. They could
also play an important role in an intelligent learning machine.
<p>
Several of these criteria will remain rather obscure until
later. In particular, the first two can only be understood on
the basis of a distinction between what is conceivable or
representable and what is really possible in the world. We now
examine this, in order to explain the difference between the
first two interpretative subgoals of science, namely (a)
extending what is conceivable or representable and (b) extending
knowledge of what is really possible.
<p>
<a name="2.4."></a>
<h3><b>
2.4. Part Four: Elucidating subgoal (b)
</b></h3>
<a name="2.4.1."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.4.1. Conceivable or representable versus really possible
</I>
</b></h3>
The second interpretative aim of science is to find out what
kinds of things really are possible in the world and not merely
conceivable. This includes such aims as finding out what sorts
of physical substances, what kinds of transformations of energy,
what kinds of chemical reactions, what kinds of astronomical
objects and processes, what kinds of plants and animals, what
kinds of animal behaviour, what kinds of mental development,
what kinds of mental abnormality, what kinds of language
and what kinds of social changes can exist or occur.
<p>
This aim is indefinitely extensible: having found out that
X's can exist or occur, one can then try to find out whether
X's can exist or occur in specified conditions C1, C2, C3, ....
Similarly, having found that objects can have one range of
properties which can change (e.g. length) and can also have
another range of properties which can change (e.g.
temperature) one can then try to find out whether these properties
can change independently of each other in the same object,
such as a bar of metal, or a particular object in specified
circumstances, such as a bar of metal under constant pressure or
tension.
<I>
Such further exploration of the
limits of combinations of known possibilities
merges into the
search for laws</I>
and regularities,
as explained previously.
<p>
We can conceive of, or describe, a lump of wood turning
spontaneously into gold, or a human living unclothed in a
vacuum, but it does not follow that these things really can
exist. What is the difference? First we look at what it is for
something to be conceivable, representable, or describable.
<p>
<a name="2.4.2."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.4.2. Conceivability as consistent representability
</I>
</b></h3>
As philosophers well know, the subjective feeling of
intelligibility, the feeling of having understood or imagined
something, is no guarantee that anything consistent was
understood, imagined or conceived of. If someone claims to be able
to conceive of the set of all sets which do not contain
themselves, then provided he is using words in the normal way we
can show, by Russell's well known argument, using steps that
he will accept if he is reasonable, that he was wrong, or that
his 'conceiving' amounted to nothing more than repeating the
phrase, or some equivalent, to himself.<a href="#chap2-note2">[2]</a>
<p>
A sentence, phrase, picture, diagram, or other complex
symbol will, if intelligible, be part of a language which
includes syntactic and semantic rules in accordance with
which the symbol is to be interpreted. The mere fact that the
symbol is syntactically well-formed does not guarantee that
it can be interpreted, though it may mislead us into thinking
it can. More precisely, it may have a <i>sense</i> but necessarily fail
to have any <i>denotation.</i> Thus the question 'Does the table
exist more slowly than the chair?' is syntactically perfect but
we can show that so long as the words are used according to
normal semantic rules there can be no answer to the question.
For, 'more slowly' when qualifying a verb requires that verb
to denote a process or sequence involving changes other than
the change of time, so that the rate of change or succession
can be measured against time. Existence is not such a process,
so rates of existence cannot be compared. (For more on the
connection between sense and failure of reference see
<a href="#sloman-71a">Sloman (1971b)</a>.)
<p>
We can use the notion of what is or is not coherently
describable or representable in some well defined language or
representational system, as an objective semantic notion.
What is conceivable to a person, will be what is coherently
representable in some symbolic system which he uses, not
necessarily fully consciously. It may be very hard, even for
him, to articulate the system he uses, but that does not
disprove its existence. These notions are as objective as the
notion of logical consistency, which is a special case.
<p>
However the mere fact that something is, in this sense,
representable or conceivable does not mean that it really can
exist. Conversely, what can exist need not be representable or
conceivable using the symbolic resources available to scientists
(or others) at any particular time: their language may need to
be extended. Scientists (like children) may be confronted with
an instance of some possibility, like inertial motion,
diffraction, or curvature of space-time, without seeing it as such
because they lack the concepts. (Kuhn, 1962, chapter X, has
over-dramatised this by saying they inhabit a different world.)
<p>
The word 'possible' as I have used it, and as others use it,
tends to slide between the two cases (a) used as a synonym
for 'consistently representable or describable using some
representational system', as in logically possible', and (b) used
to refer to what can occur or exist in the world. This is why
the first two interpretative aims of science are not always
clearly distinguished. But what is the difference between (a)
and (b)?
<p>
This is not an easy question to answer. The main difference
is that conceivability or representability can be established
simply by analysing the sentence or other symbol used and
checking that the syntactic and semantic rules of the language
in question do not rule out a consistent interpretation (which
is not always easy), whereas checking whether something
really is or is not possible requires empirical investigation of
some sort. The former involves conceptual analysis
(see chapter 4), the latter perception, experiments or surveys.
<p>
<a name="2.4.3."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.4.3. Proving real possibility or impossibility
</I>
</b></h3>
If an actual example is found, that conclusively establishes its
real possibility. To establish real <i>impossibility</i> is very much
harder, and perhaps it can never be conclusively established.
However one can sometimes be fairly sure that something is
not possible in the world either because of extensive and
varied attempts to realise it, or on the basis of inference from
some well established theory. (For instance, I am convinced
by physical and biological arguments that it is impossible for
a human being to live without clothing in a vacuum.)
<p>
However, possibility is not the same as actual existence. To
say that it is possible for ten drugged alligators to be painted
with red and yellow stripes and then piled into my bath is not
to say that this ever has happened or will happen. Similarly,
to say that several courses of action are possible for me, is not
to say that I shall actually follow all of them. So, in saying
that one of the aims of interpretative science is to find out
which kinds of things are possible in the world, I do not mean
that the aim is to find out which kinds actually exist, as in
historical science. The latter is just a means to the former.
<p>
What other means are there of deciding that something is
really possible, besides finding an instance? Alas, the only
answer I can give to this is that we can reasonably, though
only tentatively, infer that something is possible if we have
an explanation of its possibility. What this amounts to is
roughly the following: (a) we can consistently represent it
using symbolic resources which have already been shown to
be useful in representing what is actual, and (b) it is not ruled
out by any well established law or theory specifying
limitations on possibilities.
<p>
It is clear that these conditions do not conclusively prove
something to be possible, for they rest on current theories of
the limitations of what is possible and such theories, being
empirical, are bound to include errors and omissions, at any
stage in the advance of science. Further, these conditions do
not yield clear decisions in all cases. For instance, is it
reasonable to believe that it is possible for a normal human being to
be trained (perhaps starting from birth) to run a mile in three
minutes? It may not be clear whether we already know
enough to settle such a question.

<a name="2.4.4."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.4.4. Further analysis of 'possible' is required
</I>
</b></h3>
These conditions for proving unrealised possibilities need to
be further defined and illustrated. For the present, however,
my aim is simply to indicate roughly how something can be
shown to be possible without producing an instance. So I
have demonstrated that possibility is a different concept from
conceivability (or coherent representability), and also
different from existence.
<p>
But I still have not given anything approximating to a
complete analysis: this would require very much more than
describing the criteria for deciding whether something is
possible or not. It would also require analysis of the role of the
concept of possibility in our thinking, problem-solving,
deliberating, regretting, blaming, praising, etc., and its
relations to a whole family of modal words, such as 'may',
'can', 'might', 'could', 'would', etc. A mammoth task. (For
some useful beginnings see Gibbs, 1970 and White, 1975.) A
good analysis would be part of a design for a mind.
<p>
At any rate, we cannot analyse 'Things of type X are
possible' as <i>synonymous</i> with 'Either things of type X already
exist, or else they are consistently representable in our
symbolic system without being ruled out by known laws', since
this would define real possibility in terms of the <i>current</i>
system of concepts and beliefs. We could try a formula like
'Things of type X are possible if and only if they either exist
or are consistently representable in some useful
representational system and are not ruled out by any true laws'. But
this has the disadvantage of presupposing that there exists
some complete set of true laws formulated in some
unspecified language which correctly defines all the limitations on
what is possible in the world. It is by no means clear that
such a presupposition is intelligible. Moreover as a definition
it introduces a circularity, since it is notoriously hard to
define the concept of a law without presupposing the concept
of possibility or some related concept.
<p>
Despite the remaining obscurities, I hope I have done
enough to indicate both that the first two aims of
interpretative science are different, and also that they are very closely
related. Now for a closer look at the third aim  the aim of
explaining possibilities.

<I>
2.5.1. Explanations of possibilities
</I>
</b></h3>
A request for an explanation of a possibility or range of
possibilities is characteristically expressed in the form 'How is X
possible?' Unfortunately, the role of such explanations in our
thought is obscured by the fact that not everyone who
requires, seeks or finds such an explanation, or who learns
one from other people, asks this sort of question explicitly, or
fully articulates the explanation when he has understood it.
This partially explains why the role of possibilities and their
explanations in science has not been widely acknowledged.
<p>
Roughly, an explanation of a possibility or range of
possibilities can be defined to be some theory or system of
representation which <i>generates</i> the possibility or set of
possibilities, or representations or descriptions thereof. An
explanation of a range of possibilities may be/a grammar for those
possibilities. A computer program is a good illustration: it
explains the possibility of the behaviours it can generate
(which may depend on the environment in which it is
executed). In this way Artificial Intelligence provides
explanations of intelligent behaviour. There is much to be clarified
in these formulations, but first some examples from the
history of science.

</I>
</b></h3>

Some have already been superseded and others probably will
be.
<p>
<ul>
<li>The ancient theory of epicycles explained how it was
possible for the apparent paths of planets to exhibit irregularities
while the actual paths were constructed out of regular circular
motions. Known forms of motion were compounded in a
representation of new ones.
<p>
<li>The principle of the lever explained how it was possible for
a small force to be transformed into a larger force or
<I>vice versa,</I>
in a wide range of situations.
<p>
<li>Newton's gravitational theory explained how it was
possible for the moon to produce tides on earth. His theory of
the relation between force and acceleration explained how it
was possible for water to remain in a bucket swung overhead.
<p>
<li>The atomic theory after Dalton explained how various
kinds of chemical transformations were possible without any
change in basic substances. (It also explained why the range
of possibilities was restricted according to the laws of
constant and multiple proportions, so that it was vastly superior
to previous atomic theories.)
<p>
<li>The kinetic theory of heat explained, among other things,
how it was possible for heating to produce expansion, and
how heat energy and mechanical energy could be
interconvertible.
<p>
<li>The theory of natural selection explained how it was
possible for undirected ('random') mutations to lead to apparently
purposive or goal-directed changes in biological species. The
theory of genes explained how it was possible for offspring to
inherit some but not all of the characteristics of each parent,
and for different siblings to inherit different combinations.
<p>
<li>The theory of 'the selfish gene' has been used to explain the
possibility of the evolution of altruistic behaviour (Dawkins,
1977.)
<p>
<li>The theory that atoms were composed of protons,
neutrons and electrons explained many of the possibilities
summarised in the periodic table of the elements, and explained
how it was possible for one element to be transformed into
another.
<p>
<li>The wave theory of light explained how it was possible for
refraction, diffraction and polarisation effects to occur.
<p>
<li>Quantum theory explains how it is possible for particles to
produce interference effects, how it is possible for the
photo-electric effect (release of electrons from a metal by light) to
have a frequency threshold rather than an intensity threshold,
and how it is possible for complex molecules to be stable
despite thermal buffeting.
<p>
<li>
Einstein's theory of general relativity explained how it is
possible for mass and energy to be interconvertible, and for
light rays to be curved even in a vacuum. Other possibilities
explained before specimens were produced include lasers and
super-conductivity.

Erwin Schr&#246;dinger's little book <i>What is life?</i>
<a href="#schroedinger">Schr&#246;dinger(1944)</a>,
provides one of the deepest examples of an attempt by a scientist to explain how
something very complex and puzzling, namely life as we know it, is possible,
using quantum physics as an explanatory framework. An attempt to explain how it
is possible for natural selection to continually produce new forms of life,
using fundamental and derived construction kits, was begun in 2014 here (work
in progress):

Turing's <a href="#turing-morph">1952</a> paper on the Chemical basis of
morphogenesis offered an explanation of how it is possible for two chemicals
diffusing and reacting in an organism to produce a wide variety of two
dimensional patterns on the surface of the organism.
</ul>
<p>
Some of the theories listed so far not only explained possibilities, but
also contained enough detail to make prediction, and in some cases
control, possible. This is fairly common in physics, though more
difficult in biology. In the case of the human sciences (and philosophy)
the ability to predict and control is rare.
<ul>
<li>Marx's social theories
explained how it was possible for large numbers of people to
collaborate peacefully in social and economic practices
against their own interest. He also explained how it was
possible for such systems to generate forces tending to their own
overthrow.
<p>
<li>Popper has tried to explain how it is possible for the
growth of scientific knowledge to be based on rational
comparisons and assessment of theories, even though no theory
can ever be proved to be right or even probable.
<p>
<li>Chomsky's theory that human minds contain
representations of generative grammars explains how it is possible for
sentences never before heard or uttered nevertheless to be
part of a person's language. The theory (see T. Winograd
(1973)) that human minds contain certain sorts of procedures
or programs explains how it is possible for new sentences to
be produced or understood.
<p>
<li>Freud's theories attempted to explain how it is possible for
apparently meaningless slips and aberrations of behaviour to
be significant actions. Piaget's theories about the structure of
many familiar concepts attempt to explain how it is possible
for a child to show in some behaviour that he has grasped the
concept and in others that he has not.
<p>
<li>In a later chapter I shall sketch a computational mechanism
which explains how it is possible for many kinds of knowledge,
skills and other resources to be used in a flexible and
integrated way by a single person.
<p>
<li>Work in artificial intelligence explains how certain kinds of perception are
possible. (E.g. see <a href="#chap9">Chapter 9</a>)
<p>
<li>Emotivist and prescriptivist theories in moral philosophy
explain how it is possible for moral language to be meaningful
and to perform a useful function without being a sub-species
of descriptive language. Frege, Russell and Whitehead, showed
how it was possible for a great deal of mathematical
knowledge to be based on logical knowledge. (Some of these
examples support the view that aims and methods of
philosophy overlap with those of science.)

<a name="2.5.3."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.5.3. Some unexplained possibilities
</I>
</b></h3>
Known possibilities for which explanations are still lacking
abound. Consider the possibility of the growth of an oak
from an acorn or a chicken from an egg. Fragments of the
mechanism are of course understood already, but there is as
yet no explanation of how such an apparently simple
structure as a seed or fertilised ovum can <i>control</i> its own
development in such a way as to produce such a complex structure as
a plant or animal. In the terminology introduced below, we
can say that as yet the <i>fine structure</i> of these known
possibilities is unexplained, despite the optimism which followed
the discovery of the structure of DNA.
<p>
Another unexplained possibility is the evolution of animals
with specific intelligent abilities (like the ability to learn to
use tools, or to learn to use language) from species lacking
these abilities, and in particular the evolution of human
beings.
<p>
In the case of human psychology, there are very many
possibilities taken for granted as part of common sense, yet
still without even fragmentary explanations, for instance the
possibility of a newborn infant learning whatever human
language happens to be spoken around it, the possibility of
producing a work of art, the possibility of extending an art
form or language, the possibility of using knowledge acquired
in one context to solve a problem of a quite different sort,
the possibility of relating one's actions to tastes, preferences,
principles, hopes, fears, knowledge, abilities, and social
commitments, and the possibility of changing one's moral
attitudes through personal experience.
<p>
There are missing explanations of possibilities in physics
and chemistry also. As far as I know, the possibility of
mechanical utilisation of fuel energy at levels of efficiency achieved
in animals is still not explained.
<p>
<a name="2.5.4."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.5.4. Formal requirements for explanations of possibilities
</I>
</b></h3>
The explanations listed earlier may not be correct
explanations, but they at least meet formal conditions for
explaining certain possibilities, or perhaps would do if precisely
formulated. These conditions will be described below. They
are generalisations and elaborations of the basic idea, familiar
from writings of philosophers like Popper, Hempel and Nagel,
that to explain something by means of a theory is to deduce
it from the theory, perhaps with some additional premisses.
<p>
Such philosophers normally assume that both the theory
and what it explains are expressed in the form
of sentences, using
natural language supplemented by the technical language
of the science concerned. It is also assumed that the deduction
is <i>logical,</i> that is the inference from theory to what
it explains
can be shown to be valid according to the rules of inference
codified by logicians. (This is sometimes generalised to permit
cases where the inference is only probabilistic.)
<p>
This concept of deduction and the related notion of
explanation needs to be generalised in two ways. First of all, other
means of representation besides sentences may be used, such
as maps, diagrams, three-dimensional models or computer
programs. Secondly,
<I>
the forms of inference
</I>
include
not only
the <i>logical</i> forms (like 'All A's are B's, All B's are C's.
Therefore All A's are C's'), but also the manipulation of other
representations. An example is the manipulation of diagrams
representing molecular structures, in order to explain the
possibility of chemical reactions, like the production of water
from hydrogen and oxygen.
<p>
I shall explain in chapter 7 exactly what 'valid' means
and why this generalisation to non-verbal forms of valid
inference should be permitted. Just as the semantic rules of
verbal languages guarantee that certain transformations of
sentences preserve truth, so can semantic rules of non-verbal
representations guarantee that certain manipulations preserve
denotation. (This generalisation of the concept of a valid
inference is central to the analysis of the elusive concepts of
'cause' and 'mechanistic explanation'  but that is another
story.)
<p>
Typical examples of such non-verbal inference methods
are: the use of Venn diagrams in set theory, the
'parallelogram' representation of addition of forces, velocities and
other vectors, the use of circuit-diagrams in electronics, the
use of a map to select a route, the use of a diagram to show
how a machine works. On this view the use of models and
so-called 'analogies' in science is simply a change of language:
one configuration is used to represent another. All the usual
talk about isomorphism of models in this context is as
misconceived as the theory that sentences in natural language
must be isomorphic with things they describe: there are many
more kinds of non-verbal representations than isomorphic
models. (See Goodman, 1968, Clowes, 1971, and Toulmin,
1953). I was helped to see all this by an unpublished paper
by Max Clowes, called 'Paradigms and syntactic models'.)
<p>
We now have a minimal requirement for a theory <b>T</b>
formulated in sentences or other symbolic apparatus to be an
explanation of some range of possibilities, namely:
<br>
<ol>
<li>Statements or other representations of the range of
possibilities should be validly derivable from <b>T</b>, according to
whatever criteria for validity are generated by the
semantics of the language' used for <b>T</b>.
</ol>
<p>
An illustration of this is the use of the theory of bonds
between atoms (the theory of valencies) to explain the
possibility of a very large number of chemical compounds and
transformations. Knowing the kinds of bonds into which the
various atoms can enter, one can generate representations of
large numbers of chemical compounds, and chemical reactions,
using diagrams or models of molecular structures. Here one
range of (relatively primitive) possibilities is used to explain
another range.
<p>
This simple chemical theory had to be revised and refined
of course, but that does not affect the point that at least part
of its scientific function while it survived was to explain a
range of possibilities according to
criterion (1).
(In AI research, a program can explain a range of possible behaviours.
A derivation consists of running the program, or, preferably,
reasoning about the program's capabilities.)
<p>

<a name="2.5.5."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.5.5. Criteria for comparing explanations of possibilities
</I>
</b></h3>
However, there are additional requirements if <b>T</b> is to be a
<i>good</i> explanation of the possibilities in question, or at least
better than its rivals. Rival theories are assessed according to
how well they meet these additional requirements, namely:
<p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The theory <b>T</b> should be as <i>definite</i> as possible: that
is,
there should be a clear demarcation between what it
does and what it does not explain. For instance,
although early theories of sub-atomic structure
definitely permitted an atom with one proton (hydrogen) to
have zero or one neutrons, I doubt that they definitely
permitted or ruled out the possibility of an isotope of
hydrogen with one proton and, say, twenty neutrons, as
more modern theories do.
<p>
<li><b>T</b> should be <i>general,</i> that is, it should explain many
significantly different possibilities, preferably including
some possibilities not known about before the theory
was invented. This criterion should be used with caution.
Insofar as a theory generates some possibilities not yet
established by actual instances, efforts should be made
to find or create instances. If repeated efforts to find
actual instances fail, this does not disprove the theory,
but it does reduce its credit. So a theory should not
explain too many things.
<p>
<li><b>T</b> should account <i>for fine structure:</i> i.e. the
descriptions
or representations of possibilities generated by <b>T</b> should
be rich and detailed. Thus a theory merely explaining
the possibility of different chemical elements in terms
of different possible constituents of their atoms will not
be as good as one which also explains how it is possible
for the elements listed on the periodic table to have
exactly the similarities and differences of properties
implied in the table.
<p>
<li><b>T</b> should be <i>non-circular,</i> i.e. the possibilities assumed in
<b>T</b> should not be of essentially the same character as the
possibilities <b>T</b> purports to explain. Many philosophical
and psychological theories fail this test; computer-based
models of human competence pass it, since assuming the
possibility of a computer is quite different from
assuming the possibility of a mind! However, notice that a
kind of circularity, namely recursion, is possible <i>within</i>
such an explanation. Behaviourist psychology is based
on a failure to see this. (See chapter 1, section 3.)
<p>
<li>The derivations from <b>T</b> should be <i>rigorous</i>; i.e. within
the range of possibilities explained by <b>T</b>, the procedures
by which those possibilities are deduced or derived
should be explicitly specified so that they can be
publicly assessed, and not left to the intuitions of
individuals. If the theory is very complex, the only way to find
out exactly what it does and does not imply (or explain)
may be to express it in a computer program and observe
the output in a range of test situations. (This takes the
place of logical or mathematical deduction.) In fact
rigour is very rarely achieved, even in the physical
sciences.
<p>
<li>The theory <b>T</b>
should be <i>plausible:</i> that is, insofar as it
makes any assertions or has any presuppositions about
what is the case or what is possible, these should not
contradict any known facts. However, sometimes the
development of a new theory may lead to the refutation
of previously widely held beliefs, so this criterion has to
be used with great discretion.
<p>
<li>The theory should be <i>economical:</i> i.e. it should not
include assumptions or concepts which are not required
to explain the possibilities it is used to explain.
Sometimes economy is taken to mean the use of relatively
few concepts or assumptions, from which others can be
derived as necessary. The latter is not always a good
thing to stress, since great economy in primitive
concepts can go along with uneconomical derivations and
great difficulty of doing anything with the theory, that
is, with <i>heuristic poverty.</i> For instance, the logicist basis
for mathematics proposed by Frege, Russell and
Whitehead is very economical in terms of primitive concepts,
axioms, and inference rules, yet it is very difficult for a
practising mathematician to think about deep
mathematical problems if he expresses everything in terms of
that basis, using no other concepts. Replacing numerical
expressions by equivalents in the basic logical notation
produces unmanageably complex formulae, and
excessively long and unintelligible proofs. The main points get
buried in a mass of detail, and so cannot easily be
extracted for use in other contexts. More usual methods
have greater heuristic power. So economy is not always
a virtue. This is also true of Artificial Intelligence models.

<p>
<li>The theory should be rich in <i>heuristic power:</i> i.e. the
concepts, assumptions, symbolisms, and transformation
procedures of the theory should be such as to make the
detection of gaps and errors, the design of
problem-solving strategies, the recognition of relevant evidence,
and so on, easily manageable. This is a very difficult
concept to define precisely, but it is not a subjective
concept. The heuristic power of a theory may be a
consequence of its logical structure, as people working in
artificial intelligence have been forced to notice. (See
<a href="#chap7">Chapter 7</a> below,
and <a href="#mccarthy-hayes">McCarthy and Hayes, (1969)</a> for more on this.)
<p>
<li>The theory should be <i>extendable</i> (compare
Lakatos 1970). That is, it should be possible to embed
the theory in an improved enlarged theory explaining
more possibilities or more of the fine-structure of
previously explained possibilities. For instance a theory
explaining how people understand language, which
cannot be combined with a perceptual theory to explain
how people can talk about what they see, or use their
eyes to check what they are told, is inferior to a
linguistic theory which can be so extended. Extendability is a
major criterion for assessing artificial intelligence models
of human abilities. However, it is a criterion which can
only be applied in retrospect, after further research
attempting to extend the model or theory.
</ol>
<p>
So a good explanation of a range of possibilities should be
definite, general (but not too general), able to explain fine
structure, non-circular, rigorous, plausible, economical, rich
in heuristic power, and extendable.
<p>
<a name="2.5.6."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.5.6. Rational criticism of explanations of possibilities
</I>
</b></h3>
These criteria indicate ways in which theories explaining
possibilities may be criticised rationally. For instance, one may be
able to show (by a logical or mathematical argument or by
'running' it on a computer) that the theory does not in fact
generate the range of possibilities it is said to explain. (Nearly
all psychological theories put forward to explain known
human possibilities, such as perception, fail on this point: the
theories generate the required range of possibilities only in
the mind of a sympathetic audience supplying a large and
unspecified set of additional assumptions.)
<p>
A theory explaining a range of possibilities may be
criticised by showing that it explains too much, including things
which so far appear to be impossible. The theory may not
explain enough of the known fine structure of the possibilities
(like theories of speech understanding which do not explain
how hearers can cope with complex syntactic ambiguities, or
developmental theories in biology which don't explain how a
chicken's egg can grow into something like its mother or
father in so many detailed ways).
<p>
The explanation may be circular, like theories which
attempt to explain human mental functioning by assuming
the existence of a spirit or soul with essentially all the abilities
it is intended to explain.
<p>
The theory may be so indefinite that it is not clear what it
does and what it does not explain.
<p>
A theory may also be criticised less directly by criticising
the specification of the range of possibilities which it is meant
to explain (e.g. criticising the typology on.which it is based).
For instance the specification may describe a set of structures
in ways which are not related to their functions, like
describing sentences in terms of transition probabilities between
successive words.
<p>
Or the set of possibilities explained may be shown to be
only a sub-range of some wider set of possibilities which the
theory cannot cope with. For instance, a theory which
explains how <i>statements</i> are constructed and understood can
be criticised if it cannot be extended to account for
<i>questions, commands, threats, requests, promises, bets, contracts,
</i> and
other types of verbal communication which are clearly
functionally related to statements in that they use related
syntactic structures and almost the same vocabulary.
<p>
If it turns out that a physical theory of the interactions of
atoms and their components can only explain the possibility
of chemical reactions involving relatively simple molecules,
then that will show an inadequacy in the theory.
<p>
Similarly, if an economic theory can explain only the
possibility of economic processes occurring when there is a very
restricted amount of information flow in a community, then
that theory is not good enough.
<p>
Finally, if a philosophical theory of the function of moral
language accounts only for abusive and exhortative uses of
that kind of language, then it is clearly inadequate since moral
language can be used in a much wider range of ways.
<p>
In some cases, whether a theory explaining some specified
range of possibilities satisfies these criteria or not, or whether
it satisfies them better than a rival theory, is not an
empirical question. It is a question to be settled by conceptual,
logical and mathematical investigations of the structure of
the theory and of what can be derived from it.
<p>
Sometimes the theory is too complex for its properties to
be exhaustively surveyed. If so, one can only try out various
derivations or manipulations in test cases. This is partly
analogous to an empirical investigation in that the results are
always partial and cannot be worked out in advance by
normal human reasoning. Similarly testing a complex computer
program may feel like conducting some kind of experiment.
Nevertheless, as already remarked, the connections so
discovered are not empirical, but logical or mathematical in
nature. (Compare Pylyshyn 1978, <a href="#sloman-78">Sloman, 1978</a>.)
<p>
These criteria for assessing explanations of possibilities
could be justified by showing how their use contributes to
the interpretative and practical aims of science.
They would also have to play a role in the design of an
intelligent learning machine, along with the previously listed
criteria for assessing concepts and symbolisms. So these
criteria are relevant to developmental psychology and AI,
as well as to
the methodology of the physical sciences.

<a name="2.5.7."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.5.7. Prediction and control
</I>
</b></h3>
A theory may meet the conditions listed above without being
of any use in predicting or explaining particular events or in
enabling events or processes to be controlled. This is why I
have stressed the explanation <i>of possibilities</i>
<p>
Although it explains how certain sorts of phenomena are
possible, the underlying mechanism or structure postulated
may, at the time the theory is proposed, be unobservable, so
that observation of its state cannot be used to predict actual
occurrences of those phenomena. Similarly, no techniques
may be available for manipulating the mechanisms, so that
the theory provides no basis for controlling the phenomena.
<p>
For instance, the theory of evolution explains the
possibility of a wide range of biological developments without
providing a basis for predicting or controlling most of them.
<p>
Similarly, a theory explaining the possibility of my uttering
sentences of particular forms need not provide any basis for
predicting when I will utter any one sentence, or for making
me utter it, or even for explaining exactly why I uttered the
particular sentence I did utter at a particular time. This is
because the theory may simply postulate a certain kind of
sentence-generating mechanism, available in my mind as a
resource to be used along with other resources. How any
particular resource is used on any particular occasion, may be
the result of myriad complex interactions between such
factors as my purposes, preferences, hopes, fears and moral
principles, what I believe to be the case at the time, what I
know about the likely effects of various actions, how much I
am distracted and so on. The theory which explains the
possibility of generating and understanding sentences need not
specify all the interactions between the postulated mechanism
and other aspects of the mind. So it need not provide a basis
for prediction and control.
<p>
This is true of any explanation of an ability, skill, talent,
or power, in terms of a mechanism (e.g. a computer program)
making it possible. The explanation need not specify the rest
of the system of which that resource is a part, nor specify the
conditions under which the resource is activated. And even if
it does, the specification need not refer to either observable
conditions or manipulable conditions. So such explanations
of possibilities, though they contribute to scientific
understanding, need not contribute to predictions of actual events.
<p>
I believe that the stress on predictive content derives from
a misunderstanding of criteria 2 and 4, namely the
requirement that the theory be definite and capable of explaining

For it is a fact about the logic of possibility that 'X is
possible' does not entail 'X will occur at some time or other'.
Similarly 'X never occurs' does not entail 'X is impossible'.
Newtonian mechanics entails that it is possible for some very
large body passing near the earth to deflect the earth from its
orbit, and it explains this possibility: but the fact that this
never occurs casts no doubt on the theory. Similarly, a
grammatical theory may explain the possibility of the utterance of
a certain rather complex English sentence, and even though
nobody ever utters that sentence naturally, this casts no
doubt on the theory. A psychological theory may imply that
it is possible for a human being to count backwards from
ninety-nine to one to the tune of 'Silent night, holy night',
without being refuted merely by the fact that nobody ever
does this. Only a much more complex theory, taking into
account a rich set of motives and beliefs, could ever be used
to predict such a performance, and perhaps be refuted by its
non-occurrence.
<p>
Lack of predictive power, practical utility, or refutability
need not rule out rational discussion of the scientific merits
of an explanation of a range of possibilities. Neither should it
rule out rational comparison with rival explanations, in
accordance with the criteria listed above. Nor does it prevent
such a theory from giving deep insight, of a kind which
provides a firm basis for building more elaborate theories which
do permit predictions and explanations of particular events,
and which are empirically refutable.
<p>
I therefore see no reason for calling such theories
nonsensical, as some of the logical positivists would, nor for
banishing them from the realm of science into metaphysics
or pseudo-science, as Popper does, (though he admits that
metaphysical theories may be rationally discussable and may
be a useful stimulus to the development of what he calls
scientific theories).
<p>
I am not here arguing over questions of meaning: I am not
arguing about the definition of 'science'. My point is that
among the major merits of the generally agreed most profound
scientific theories is the fact that they satisfy the criteria for
being good explanations of possibilities, and therefore give us
good insights into the nature of the kinds of objects, events
or processes that can exist or occur in the universe.
<p>
If unrefutable theories are to be dubbed 'metaphysical',
then what I am saying is that even important scientific
theories have a metaphysical component, and that the
precision, generality, fine structure, non-circularity, rigour,
plausibility, economy and heuristic power are among the
objective criteria by which scientific and metaphysical
theories are in fact often assessed (and should be assessed).
<p>
The development of such 'metaphysical' theories is so
intimately bound up with the development of science that to
insist on a demarcation is to make a trivial semantic point, of
limited theoretical interest. Moreover, it has bad effects on
the training of scientists. Since Artificial Intelligence produces
unfalsifiable, but rationally criticisable, theories, it should
undermine this harmful trend.
<p>
<a name="2.5.9."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.5.9. Empirical support for explanations of possibilities
</I>
</b></h3>
Even though a theory which explains only possibilities is not
refutable empirically, that does not mean that empirical
evidence is wholly irrelevant to it. For instance, if a kind of
possibility explained by the theory is observed for the first
time after the theory was constructed, then this is empirical
corroboration for the theory, even though the theory did not
specify that the phenomenon ever would occur, or that it
would occur in those particular conditions.
<p>
Observing an actual instance of a possibility explained by
some theory provides support for that theory at least to the
extent of showing that there is something for it to explain: it
shows that the theory performs a scientific function.
However, the support <i>adds</i> to previous knowledge only if it is a
new kind of possibility. Mere repetition of observations or
experiments does not increase support for a theory: it merely
checks that no errors were made in previous instances.
<p>
In these contexts all the normal stress on repeatability of
scientific experiments is unnecessary and has misled some
psychologists and social scientists into making impossible
demands of empirical studies of man and society. Repetition
may be a useful check on whether the phenomenon really is
possible (since it permits more independent witnesses to
observe it), and it provides opportunities for more detailed
examination of exactly <i>what</i> occurred, but is not logically
necessary.
<p>
Beethoven's compositions are unique. Yet it is a fact that
it was possible for a human being to create them.
That possibility requires explanation.
<p>
If a phenomenon occurs only once, then it is possible; and
its possibility needs explaining. Any explanation of that
possibility is therefore not gratuitous, and the only question that
should then arise is not whether the explanation is science or
pseudo-science, or metaphysics, but whether it is the correct
explanation. In practice, this becomes the question whether a
<i>better</i> explanation can be found for the same possibility, that
is, an explanation meeting more of the criteria (2) to (9)
above; or perhaps serving additional scientific aims besides
explaining possibilities.
<p>
The frantic pursuit of repeatability and statistically
significant correlations is based on a belief that science is a search
for laws. This can blind scientists to the need for careful
description and analysis of what <i>can</i> occur, and for
the explanation of its possibility.
<p>
Instead they try to find what <i>always</i> occurs -- a much
harder task -- and usually fail. Even if something is actually
done by very few persons, or only by one, that still shows
that it is possible for a human being, and this possibility
needs explanation as much as any other established fact. This
justifies elaborate and detailed investigation and analysis of
particular cases: a task often shirked because only laws and
significant correlations are thought fit to be published. Social
scientists have much to learn from historians and students of
literature  despite all the faults of the latter.
<p>
I have gone on at such great length about describing and
explaining possibilities because the matter is not generally
discussed in books on philosophy of science, or in courses for
budding scientists. But I do not wish to deny the importance
of trying to construct theories which can be used to explain
and predict what actually occurs, or which explain
impossibilities (laws) and observed regularities. Of two theories
explaining the same range of possibilities, one which also
explains more impossibilities and permits a wider variety of
predictions and explanations of actual events to be made on
the basis of observation, is to be preferred, since it serves to a
greater degree the aims of science listed previously.<a
href="#chap2-note3">[3]</a>
<p>
This discussion is still very sketchy and unsatisfactory.
Much finer description and classification of different sorts of
explanations is required. But enough for now!
<p>
<a name="2.6."></a>
<h3><b>
2.6. Part Six: Concluding remarks
</b></h3>
<a name="2.6.1."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
2.6.1. Can this view of science be proved correct?
</I>
</b></h3>
It is not possible to <i>prove</i> that this concern with possibilities
is a major aim of science, for anyone can say that his concept
of science is defined in terms of different aims. However, I
invite the reader to reflect on examples of what he or she
recognises to be major scientific achievements, and then to
ask whether <i>one</i> of the criteria by which they are so
recognised is not the extent to which they contributed to the stock
of conceptual or representational tools available to scientists,
or extended knowledge of what kinds of objects or events or
processes could occur.
<p>
I suggest that anyone who tries this
will discover, possibly to his surprise, that the scientific
advances which he regards as most important include not
only discoveries of new laws or regularities, or explanations
thereof, but also discoveries of new phenomena, new
explanations of ranges of possibilities, new concepts, new
notations, and therein new means of asking questions about
the world. For example, Boyle's discovery of his law relating
pressure and volume of a gas, was not so profound as the
prior invention of the concepts <i>of pressure</i> and <i>volume.</i>
The
search for laws presupposes the search for possibilities and
their explanations, and this requires concepts and notations
for representing possibilities.
<p>
For reasons which I do not fully understand, Popper is
apparently strongly opposed to all this talk of concepts and
possibilities. (See, for instance, pp. 123-4 of his (1972)
where he describes it as an error to think that <i>concepts</i> and
<i>conceptual systems</i> or problems about <i>meaning</i> are
comparable in importance to <i>theories</i> and <i>theoretical systems,</i> or
to
problems of <i>truth.)</i> As far as I can tell, his argument rests on
the curious assumption that concepts or meanings are purely
subjective things, and that only complete statements
containing them can be assessed or criticised according to objective
criteria. I hope I have said enough to refute this.
<p>
Roughly, our disagreement seems to hinge on Popper's
view that the only place for rationality in science is in the
selection from among hypotheses expressible in a given
language, whereas I have tried to show that there are rational
ways of deciding how to extend a language, and therefore
how to extend the set of expressible hypotheses. I admit that
there are still serious gaps in my discussion: a theory of
concept-formation is still lacking. (See 2008 note on "Ontology Extension"
<a href="#ontology-extension">below</a>.)
<p>
Finally, even if it is agreed that science uses rational <I>means</I>
to pursue the aims described here, the question arises: are
these <I>aims</I> rational? Is it rational to pursue them? I believe
there is no answer to this. If someone genuinely prefers the
life of a mystic or hermit or 'primitive' tribesman to the
pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the universe, then
that preference must be respected. However, I believe that
the aims and criteria described here are part of the mental
mechanism with which every human child is born  but for
which it would not be possible to learn all that human
children do learn. So one can reject science only after one has
used it, however unconsciously, for some years.
<p>
Similarly, rational processes of concept formation and
theory construction will have to be built into an intelligent
robot if it is to be capable of matching the learning ability of
young children. The development of science, the learning of
a child, and the mechanisms necessary for an intelligent robot
all involve computational processes, which build up and
deploy knowledge of the form and contents of the world. This
is one of several points at which bridges can be built between
philosophy of science, developmental psychology, and
artificial intelligence.
<p>
The attempt to build these bridges will provide good tests
for the philosophical theories outlined here. It is certain that
my theories will prove inadequate. But I hope they may
provide a useful basis for further research.

<br>
"Definitional" and "Substantive" ontology extensions</b>
<div style="margin-left:15px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px;">
We can distinguish two kinds of ontology extension: "definitional"
and "substantive".
<p>
In the first kind, a new concept, predicate, function, or logical
operator is defined explicitly in terms of previously used concepts,
etc. Thus nothing new can be thought or expressed as a result of the
extension, though some things may be expressed or thought more
concisely. Definitional ontology extension introduces only
abbreviations for concepts and forms of expression that existed
previously.
<p>
In substantive ontology extension, something new is introduced that
is not definable in terms of what was previously understood.
According to <i>concept empiricism</i> (defended by the British Empiricist
Philosophers, and criticised by Immanuel Kant in his
<i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> (1781)),
the only way to acquire such a novel concept is to derive it (somehow) from
experience of instances, e.g. experiencing a new colour, or taste, or smell.
Approximately the same claim has been central to "Symbol Grounding" theory,
introduced by Stevan Harnad (over a decade after this book had been published,
apparently in ignorance of Kant's refutation of the theory, and its
rejection by modern philosophers of science).
<blockquote>
The Symbol Grounding Problem,
<i>Physica D,</i>
42,
1990,
 pp. 335--346,
</blockquote>
However, the advance of science shows that it is possible to
introduce new theoretical concepts that are neither abstracted from
experience of instances (e.g. because instances cannot be
experienced) nor defined in terms of previous concepts. E.g. this
happened with concepts like proton, electron, charge, valence,
chemical bond, magnetic field, gene, and others. The failure of
logical empiricists to explain such conceptual innovations in terms
compatible with concept empiricism led to new ideas about concepts
that are implicitly defined by the theories that use them. For more

SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY
</b></h2>
<p>
<a name="3.1."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
3.1. Introduction
</I>
</b></h3>
Immanuel Kant's <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> is widely
acknowledged to have been a major contribution to philosophy. Yet
much of the book can also be seen as an early contribution to
theoretical psychology. For example, his claim that no
experience is possible without some form of prior knowledge
(a claim to which we shall return in the chapter on perception)
is relevant to psychologists' attempts to understand the nature
of perception and learning. His notion that perception and
imagination require the use not of picture-like templates, but
of rule-like schemata for analysing and synthesising images,
has been re-invented by psychologists in this century and
plays an important role in computer-based theories of
perception.
<p>
So Kant's work illustrates the overlap between science and
philosophy. There are many more examples. Einstein's
approach to the analysis of concepts of space and time was
influenced by his reading of empiricist philosophy. Frege's
attempts to answer some of Kant's questions about the
nature of arithmetical knowledge led him into logical and
semantic theories and formalisms which have deeply
influenced work in linguistics and computer science. Marx's
sociological theories were partly based on Hegel's philosophy.
More recently, work by philosophers of language, such as
Austin and Grice, has been taken up and developed by
linguists, and the psychologist Heider has acknowledged the
influence of Ryle's <i>The Concept of Mind.</i>
<p>
Philosophers' analyses of some of our most general
concepts, such as <i>cause, individual, action, purpose, event, process, good,</i> and <i>true,</i> are relevant to biology, to
anthropology
and developmental psychology, whether or not practitioners
of these subjects are aware of this.
<p>
<! page 64
-->
For instance, biologists studying the evolution of
intelligence need to grasp what intelligence is, and how it includes
the use of some or all of these concepts. A comprehensive
anthropology would include cross-cultural studies of the
most general and basic systems of concepts used by different
peoples. And if developmental psychologists were to do their
job properly they would spend a lot of time exploring such
concepts in order to be able to ask deep questions about what
children learn and how. (Piaget did this, to some extent. But
I am not aware of university courses in developmental
psychology which include training in conceptual analysis.)
<p>
Within artificial intelligence it is not possible to avoid
philosophical analysis of such concepts, for the discipline of
trying to design machines which actually behave intelligently
and can communicate with us forces one into analysis of the
preconditions of intelligent behaviour and our shared
presuppositions. For otherwise the machines don't work!
<p>
These illustrations of the connections between philosophy
and the scientific study of the world are not isolated
exceptions. Rather, they are consequences of the fact that the aims
and methods of philosophy overlap with those of science. In
this chapter I shall try to analyse the extent of that overlap.
<p>
<a name="3.2."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
3.2. The alms of philosophy and science overlap
</I>
</b></h3>
In particular, the greatest philosophers have shared with the
greatest scientists the first three 'interpretative' aims listed in
chapter 2, namely the aim of developing good concepts or
thinking tools, the aim of finding out what sorts of things are
possible, and the aim of trying to explain these possibilities.
Their methods of pursuing these aims have much in common
too, as will be shown below.

<p>
A fourth major aim that they appear to have in common
is the aim of discovering limits to what is possible, and
explaining such limits. However, in relation to this aim, the methods
of scientists and philosophers tend to be rather different,
insofar as philosophers often try to set up non-empirical
demonstrations. And they usually fail.
<p>
By exploring the relationship between the aims and
methods of science and philosophy we shall explain how it is
possible for philosophy to be the mother of science, thereby
perhaps making a philosophical contribution to the science of
intellectual history.
<p>
Let us start with some reminders of the kinds of questions
which have exercised philosophers. I shall ignore the many
pseudo-questions posed by incompetent philosophers who
cannot tell the difference between profundity and obscurity.
<p>
<a name="3.3."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
3.3. Philosophical problems of the form 'How is X possible?'
</I>
</b></h3>
Many questions of the form 'How is X possible?' have been
asked by philosophers. Some of them go back to the ancient
Greek philosophers, or further, while others were first
formulated much more recently. It will be seen from the long list of
examples which follows that more and less specific versions
of the same question can be asked. Detailed analysis in
philosophy or science leads to the formulation of more specific
questions, concerned with more of the fine-structure of X.
Increasing specificity increases the scientific interest of the
question. In particular, it should be clear that although the
first question listed below is a philosophical one, more
specific versions of it (e.g. the fourth one) look much more
like psychological questions.
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How is knowledge possible?
<li>How is empirical knowledge possible?
<li>How is it possible to acquire knowledge about the
material world on the basis of sensory experience?
<li>How is it possible to learn, from seen two-dimensional
surfaces, that an object is three-dimensional and has
unseen surfaces on the far side?
<li>How is it possible to know anything about the past, the
future, unobserved objects or processes, or other
people's minds? (Cf. 16).
<li>How is it possible to know that two events are causally

learn one?
<li>How is it possible to learn the language of a culture
other than one's own?
<li>How is it possible to use strings of symbols to describe

<li>How is it possible to interpret flat patterns as pictures of
solid three-dimensional objects? (Compare question 4.)
<li>How is it possible to use general concepts, such as <i>dog, triangle, game, taller,</i> or <i>between,</i> which apply to
a very
varied range of instances?
<li>How is it possible to learn the names of, think about, or
refer to, remote persons, places or events?
<li>How is it possible to think about the past or future
events? (Cf. 5.)
<li>How is it possible to think or talk about non-existent
things, such as Mr. Pickwick, Ruritania, the accident
that nearly happened this morning, or the choice I
considered but did not make?
<li>How is it possible to think about minds other than one's
own, or about another person's emotions or sensations?
<li>How is it possible to have idealised concepts which go
beyond the limits of what we can experience, such as
<i>perfectly thin, perfectly straight, perfectly parallel, exactly the same shade of colour, exactly the same</i>
<i>weight,</i> or <i>exactly the same shape"</i>
<li>How is it possible for a finite mind to think about such
infinite totalities as the set of integers, the set of points
on a line, or the set of all possible English sentences?
<li>How is it possible to have a concept of a causal
connection which is more than the concept of an instance of a
well-confirmed regularity?
<li>How is it possible to understand scientific theories
referring to things which can never be perceived?
<li>How is it possible to understand metaphors?
<li>How is it possible to understand metaphysical questions?
<li>How is it possible for a person, or a culture, to discover
that its conceptual system is inadequate, and improve it?
<li>How is it possible for there to be valid reasoning which
is not purely logical, such as inductive reasoning or
reasoning using diagrams?
<li>How is it possible for an identity-statement, such as The
Evening Star is the Morning Star', to be true, yet have a
different significance from another identity statement
referring to the same thing, such as 'The Morning Star is
the Morning Star'?
<li>How is it possible for two predicates, such as 'polygon
with three sides' and 'polygon with three angles', to
describe exactly the same set of objects yet have
different meanings?
<li>How is it possible for there to be formal, or syntactic,
tests for valid (truth-preserving) reasoning?
<li>How is it possible to have knowledge which one can use
yet not formulate (e.g. knowledge of how one's native
language works, or knowledge of the difference between
Beethoven's and Schubert's styles of composition)?
<li>How is it possible for there to be minds in a material
universe?
<li>How is it possible for physical and chemical processes to
influence or even give rise to such things as sensations
and feelings? (or vice versa?)
<li>How is it possible for there to be such a thing as
self-deceit, or unconscious beliefs, attitudes, desires, fears,
or inferences?
<li>How is it possible for a set of experiences, either at the
same time or at different times, to be the experiences of
one mind?
<li>How is it possible for a set of experiences, beliefs,
thoughts, decisions, intentions, and actions all to 'belong'
to one mind?
<li>How is it possible for deliberation, choice, or decision to
exist in a deterministic universe?
<li>How is it possible for a mind to continue to exist while
unconscious?
<li>How is it possible to think of oneself as being in a world
whose existence is independent of one's own (or any
mind's) existence?
<li>How is it possible to distinguish moral or aesthetic
evaluations from personal likes or dislikes, or to think
rationally about moral problems?
<li>How is it possible to use moral language of a kind which
does not reduce to descriptive or emotive language?
<li>How is it possible for a norm to exist in a community
without being accepted by any individual in the
community?
<li>How is it possible for democracy to exist in a state with
millions of citizens with different and conflicting aims?
<li>How is it possible for a social system to be just?
<li>How is it possible rationally to weigh up short term and
long term harm and benefit?
<li>How is it possible to search in a sensible direction for
the solution to a problem without knowing what form
the solution will take?
<li>How is it possible for an event to be temporally related
to another distant event?
<li>How is it possible to identify and re-identify places?
<li>How is it possible for objects to change their properties
and relationships (and remain the same objects)?
<li>How is it possible for there to be anything at all?
<li>How is it possible for people to invent philosophical
problems?
</ol>
<p>
Many of the questions in the list have controversial
presuppositions: it is often disputable whether the X in 'How is
X possible?' is possible at all! Many attempts have been made
to prove the impossibility of some X, for instance where X =
meaningful talk about God or infinite sets, or rational
discussion of moral issues, or even such obviously possible things
as: change, a man over-taking a tortoise in a race, knowledge
about the past, knowledge about material objects, or
deliberation and choice.
<p>
Lunatic though it may at first appear, serious thinkers have
put forward demonstrations that these are impossible.
Equally serious thinkers have put great intellectual effort into
attempts to refute such demonstrations. The process may
appear a waste of time, but has in fact been very important.
The discovery, analysis and, in some cases, refutation of such
paradoxical proofs of impossibility has been a major, though
haphazard, stimulus to philosophical progress and the growth
of human self consciousness. It leads to a deeper
understanding of the phenomenon whose possibility is in dispute. In
some cases (e.g. Zeno's paradoxes) it has even led to advances
in mathematics.
<p>
Often, a philosopher asks 'How is X possible?' only in the
context of asking 'What is the flaw in so and so's alleged proof
that X is impossible?' But there is also a more constructive
philosophical tradition, first consciously acknowledged by
Immanuel Kant, of granting that X is possible and attempting
to explain how it is, in the light of careful analysis of what X
is. This is the philosophical activity which merges into
scientific theorising.
<p>
In what follows I'll try to analyse the similarities and
differences in aims and methods: a step towards a scientific
theory explaining the possibility of the growth of scientific
and philosophical knowledge.

<h3><b>
<I>
3.4. Some general similarities and differences between science and philosophy
</I>
</b></h3>
One of the differences between science and philosophy
concerns the range of possibilities attended to. Philosophers have
mostly been concerned with possibilities which are known to
everyone or at least to educated laymen in their community,
whereas one of the characteristics of scientific research is that
it uses sophisticated apparatus and techniques, and highly
specialised explorations, in order to discover new possibilities
which are not discoverable simply by reflection on common
experience.
<p>
I do not mean that all the possibilities discussed by
philosophers are obvious: they may be known to all of us without
our realising that we know them (like the possibility of truly
unselfish action). Some of the things we know are not evident
to us until we have engaged in the philosophical activity of
digging up unacknowledged presuppositions. For instance,
most people if simply asked how many different kinds of
uses of language there are, are likely to come up with only
three or four, such as the text-book favourites: exclamations,
questions, commands and assertions (statements). But even
though they do not think of more without prodding, they do
in fact know of many possible uses of language not covered
by this list, such as betting, congratulating, pleading,
exhorting, warning, threatening, promising, consoling, reciting,
calling someone, naming someone or something, welcoming,
vowing, counting, challenging, apologising, teasing, declaring
a meeting open or closed, and several more. (See J.L. Austin,
<I>How to Do Things With Words</I>.)
<p>
Similarly, there are many psychological possibilities which
we all know about, but do not find it easy to recall and
characterise accurately when theorising about the mind. I
shall draw attention to many examples in later chapters.
So, both philosophy and science use specialised techniques
to find out what sorts of things are possible, but their
techniques and consequently the ranges of possibilities unearthed,
are different. Philosophers dig up what we all know, whereas
scientists mainly to extend what we know, about
possibilities.
<p>
In both cases a preliminary characterisation of a kind
of possibility is subject to correction, in the light of an
explanatory theory.
<p>
One of the faults of philosophers is that they tend to ask
questions which are not nearly specific enough. If one simply
asks 'How is knowledge possible?' or 'How is knowledge of
other minds possible?', these questions do not explicitly
specify the requirements to be met by explanatory answers,
since they do not describe in sufficient detail what is to be
explained. They specify many requirements implicitly,
because we all know a great deal about the possibilities referred
to, but until they have been described explicitly, people can
unwittingly select different subsets for consideration, and so
philosophical debates often go on endlessly and
fruitlessly.
<p>
The criteria listed in <a href="#chap2">Chapter 2</a>
for assessing explanations of
possibilities, presuppose that there are detailed specifications
of the range of possibilities to be explained. Otherwise there
is no agreed basis for assessing and comparing rival theories.
This preliminary analysis of the range of possibilities to be
explained is often shirked by philosophers.
<p>
Even when philosophers do a fairly deep analysis, it is not
presented in a systematic and organised form but rather in
the form used for literary essays. The result is that
philosophers often simply talk past each other. (This also happens in
psychology for similar reasons, as may be confirmed by
looking at the cursory 'definitions' of mental concepts such as
<i>emotion, memory, perception, learning,</i> etc., which
precede
lengthy chapters on empirical results and proposed theories.)
<p>
In both philosophy and science, if progress is to be made,
and seen to be made, the task of constructing an explanation
of the possibility of X must be preceded by at least a
preliminary characterisation of the range of possible kinds of X.
This
preliminary characterisation may be based on close
examination of a wide variety of examples of X, taken from common
experience, in the case of philosophy, or from specialised
experiment and observation. The specification may include
such things as the types of component, the types of
organisation of those components, the types of behaviour, the types
of function, and the types of relation to other things, found
in specimens of X, i.e. internal and external structures,
functions and relations. In both philosophy and science, the
construction of an explanatory theory will suggest ways of
improving or correcting such 'observations'.
<p>
Having got a preliminary characterisation, that is, a
preliminary answer to the question: What sort of things are X's? or
What sort of X's are possible?, the scientist or philosopher
can then begin to construct a theory describing or
representing conditions sufficient to generate the possibility of
instances of X (knowledge, perception, truth, scientific
progress, change, falling objects, chemical processes, or whatever
it is whose possibility is to be explained). Whether one is a
philosopher or a scientist, the conditions for adequacy of an
explanatory theory, and the criteria for comparing the merits
of rival explanations of a range of possibilities are the same,
namely the sorts of criteria listed in chapter 2.
<p>
Despite the overlap, there is an important difference. Often
philosophers are content to find some theoretically adequate
explanation of a set of possibilities without bothering too
much whether it is the <i>correct</i> explanation. So they ask 'How
<i>might</i> X be possible?' rather than 'How <i>is</i> X possible?', or
'What <i>could</i> explain the possibility of X?' rather than 'What
<i>does</i> explain the possibility of X?' However, every answer to
the latter necessarily includes an answer to the former, and in
that way science subsumes philosophy, which is very like the
relationship between A.I. and psychology (see chapter I ). In
practice, the difference between the two approaches becomes
significant only when alternative answers to the first question
have been formulated, so that something can be done to find
out which is a better answer to the second.
<p>
<a name="3.5."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
3.5. Transcendental deductions
</I>
</b></h3>
When one has such a theory T explaining the possibility of
<!-- page 72 -->
X's the truth of T <i>is</i> a <i>sufficient</i> condition for the
possibility
of X. However, it may not be the <i>correct</i> explanation, for
instance if T itself is false. In general it is not possible, either
in science or in philosophy, to establish conclusively that
some theory is true: the most one can do is determine which,
if any, of several theories is, for the time being, best. And even
that is not always possible when a subject is in its infancy.
<p>
However, some philosophers have not been satisfied with
this, and have tried to show that no other theory besides their
own could possibly give the correct explanation. An argument
purporting to show that T is not merely <i>sufficient</i> to explain
the possibility of X, but also <i>necessary,</i> is called a '
transcendental argument'. (As far as I know, this notion was invented
first by Kant.)
<p>
No attempts to construct valid transcendental arguments
have so far been successful. For instance, Kant tried to show
(in <i>Critique of Pure Reason)</i> that explaining the
possibility of
distinguishing the objective time order of events from the
order in which they are experienced must necessarily involve
assuming that every event has a cause; but quantum physics
shows that one can get along without assuming that every
event has a cause. Strawson tried to show (in <i>Individuals)</i> that
our ability to identify and re-identify material objects and
persons was a necessary part of any explanation of the
possibility of identifying other things such as events, processes,
states of affairs, pains, decisions, and other mental
phenomena.
<p>
But he made no attempt to survey all the possible
theories which might one day be formulated, including the
varieties of ways in which computers or robots (and
therefore people) might be programmed to use language, and his
arguments seem to be irrelevant to the detailed problems of
designing mechanisms with the ability to refer to and talk
about things. (This criticism requires further elaboration.)
<p>
Such attempts at transcendental deductions are
over-ambitious,
for to prove that some theory T is a <i>necessary</i> part
of any explanation of the possibility of X would require some
kind of survey of all possible relevant theories, including
those using concepts, notations and inference procedures not
yet developed. It is hard to imagine how anyone could
achieve this, in science or in philosophy. Scientists rarely try:
They are not as rash as philosophers.
<p>
One reason why philosophers feel they must bolster up
their explanations with 'transcendental arguments' is that
they dare not admit that philosophy can be concerned with
empirically testable theories, so they try to show that their
theories are immune from empirical criticism. However, I
shall show below that this is inconsistent with the practice of
philosophers.
<p>
We now look a little more closely at similarities and
differences between methods of science and philosophy.
<p>
<a name="3.6."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
3.6. How methods of philosophy can merge into those of science
</I>
</b></h3>
The procedures by which philosophy can make progress in
the task of describing and explaining possibilities shade
naturally into scientific procedures. So by describing such
philosophical procedures and the processes by which they
transform a problem, we begin to explain how it is possible for
philosophy to contribute to science. The overlap with AI (when AI is
done well) is specially significant.
<p>
The relevant philosophical procedures concern the
following:
<ol type="a">
<li>Collection of information about what sorts of things
are possible,
<li>Construction of new characterisations or
representations of those possibilities (i.e. answers to the question
'What is X?'),
<li>Construction of explanations of those possibilities,
and finally testing and refinement of explanatory
theories. This last step can, as in all science, lead back to
modifications of earlier steps.
</ol>
<p>
A first step is collecting information about the range of
possibilities to be explained. For instance, before attempting
to explain the possibility of knowledge one must ask 'What
is knowledge?'. This involves collecting examples of familiar
kinds of knowledge, and classifying them in some way.
(Knowledge of particular facts, knowledge of generalisations,
knowledge of individuals, knowing how to do things, etc.)
Closely related possibilities should also be surveyed, e.g.
believing, learning, inferring, proving, forgetting,
remembering, understanding, doubting, wondering whether, guessing,
etc. Functions of knowledge can then be listed and classified.
<p>
All this gives a preliminary specification of some of the <i>fine</i>
<!-- page 74 -->
<i>structure</i> of the range of possibilities to be explained, an
answer to the question 'What is X?' (or, 'What are X's?). One
can go on indefinitely attempting to improve on the
preliminary specification, by covering a wider range of cases, giving
more detailed specifications of each, and revising the
classification.
<p>
This process may at first rely only on what Wittgenstein
(in <i>Philosophical Investigations,</i> Part I, section 127) called
'assembling reminders'. These are examples of possibilities
which when stated are obvious to common-sense, since we
have all experienced similar cases, though we may not find
them easy to think of on demand, like the examples of
possible uses of language noted above. Much analytical philosophy,
and most of Wittgenstein's later philosophy, consists of this
kind of common-sense natural history.
<p>
An obvious extension of this activity is the use of
experiments, instruments, measurement, fieldwork, and other tools
of science to find and describe new examples of X, or new
facts about old examples. <a href="#chap1">Chapter 1</a>
explained how artificial intelligence can contribute to this fact-gathering
process in philosophy by providing examples of new forms of behaviour.
<p>
So the fact-collecting of philosophers merges into the
fact-collecting of scientists. However, new empirical research may
be premature if common sense knowledge about possible
sorts of X's has not yet been made explicit and systematised.
(Hence the futility of much psychological research, e.g. on
decisions, learning and emotions.) So philosophical methods
of analysis should come first in cases where relevant
information is part of common sense  for instance in the study
of mind and society. (Some linguists have appreciated this,
but few psychologists or social scientists. Fritz Heider was a
notable exception: see his <i>Psychology of Interpersonal Relations.)</i>
<p>
In philosophy, as in science, fact collection is rarely useful
unless guided by a problem or explanatory theory. The mere
collection of possibilities is of little interest except insofar as
a theory can be found to explain and organise them. And
theories are important only if they help us solve problems or
puzzles. How theories are generated is still largely an unsolved
problem. No doubt chance plays a role, but individuals like
Kant, Einstein and Newton would not have made so many
theoretical advances if they had not employed (albeit
unconsciously) rational procedures for making the best of chances
which came their way.
<p>
Artificial Intelligence in its attempts to design
intelligent (i.e.rational?) learning
planning and problem-solving systems necessarily overlaps with
philosophical attempts to explain the nature of theories and theory
formation (as outlined in <a href="#chap2">Chapter 2</a>).

<p>
<a name="3.7."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
3.7. Testing theories
</I>
</b></h3>
Once a theory T has been found which meets some or all of
the criteria listed in the
<a href="#chap2">previous chapter</a>
(see sections
2.5.4-6) for explaining the possibility of X's, the question arises
whether it is the <i>correct</i> explanation. Whether in philosophy
or in science, answering this question requires testing the
theory on new examples of X, or new, more detailed,
descriptions of old examples, in order to see whether it is sufficiently
general and explains enough fine structure. The theory can
also be related to other known facts to see whether it is
inconsistent with them and therefore false: i.e. its plausibility
can be tested.
<p>
Emotivism is a philosophical theory purporting to explain
how it is possible to use moral language meaningfully.
However, fact-collecting of the sort described above showed the
theory to be insufficiently general, for it was unable to
account for facts about moral language which were not at
first obvious to proponents of the theory, but are part of
common sense. For instance, the theory interpreted moral
language as performing functions like expressing the speaker's
emotions, evoking similar emotions in hearers and causing
hearers to act in certain ways. This fails to account for the
empirically established possibility of unemotional
hypothetical discussion among rational people of what, morally, ought
to be done in certain situations. So the theory must either be
rejected or modified to deal with this use of moral language.
(I have listed a range of facts which theories like emotivism
cannot account for, and proposed an alternative theory, in
my two papers on 'better': see bibliography.)
<p>
This example refutes the widespread assumption that
philosophical theories are not empirically testable. The
assumption is probably based on a misconstrual of what
philosophers actually do when they use empirical facts to test
<!-- Page 76 -->
or support their theories: they use widely known common
sense possibilities, rather than facts based on specialised
empirical investigation. So the work can be done in an
armchair  no laboratory is needed, nor fieldwork. (The situation
is similar when a linguist investigates his own language.)
Because the information is so readily available its <i>empirical</i>
nature is not recognised. (R.M. Hare made related points in his
'Philosophical Discoveries').
<p>
However, when the stock of relevant possibilities available
to common sense is exhausted and has to be extended by
more specialised empirical investigations, then philosophy
merges into science. For instance philosophical investigations
of the function of moral language and attempts to explain its
possibility should, if properly conducted, overlap with
linguistics and the psychology and sociology of morals. (Equally,
the psychology and sociology, if done properly, would start
with philosophical analysis of known possibilities.) For
another example of philosophical use of empirical facts, this
time from cognitive anthropology, see Bernard Harrison,
<i>Form and Content.</i>
<p>
<a name="3.8."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
3.8. The regress of explanations
</I>
</b></h3>
When a philosopher constructs his theory T, to explain a
certain range of possibilities, it will not be long before someone
asks for an explanation of the possibilities assumed in T. This
may also lead towards scientific theorising and testing. For
instance, Emotivism assumes (correctly) that it is possible for
people to influence one another's actions and emotions by
talking, and uses this to explain (wrongly) how moral language
is possible. But the assumed possibilities also need explaining:
and this leads directly into scientific studies of language and
mind, e.g. studies of how utterances can influence attitudes.
<p>
Similarly, philosophers have often tried to explain the
possibility of knowledge on the assumption that it is possible
for things to be learnt from experience, and in particular that
it is possible for ideas to become 'associated' with one
another. But these assumed possibilities also need explaining,
and this leads directly into scientific studies (in artificial
intelligence and psychology) of ways in which information
can be acquired and stored so as to be available for future
use, and so as to enable one piece of information to 'evoke'
another (which involves tricky problems of indexing and
retrieval).
<p>
<a name="3.9."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
3.9. The role of formalisation
</I>
</b></h3>
As specifications of phenomena to be explained become more
detailed and cover a wider range of possibilities, so that more
complex constraints have to be satisfied by the explanatory
theory, it becomes necessary to invent special symbolisms
and technical concepts in order to formulate theories which
are sufficiently rich, powerful and precise.
<p>
In this way philosophy sometimes becomes more
mathematical, as can be seen especially in the case of logic but also
in philosophical studies of probability, in philosophy of
science, and even in some branches of moral philosophy.
Increasingly the formalisms of Artificial Intelligence will be
used, as philosophical theories become more complex and
precise, and too intricate to be evaluated without the aid of
a computer. This parallels the ways in which scientific
theories become more and more mathematical.
<p>
For instance, if, instead of the usual vague and general
philosophical discussions of how perception can yield
knowledge, an explanation is required <i>of how specific sorts</i> of perceptual experiences can yield knowledge
<i>of specific sorts</i>
of spatial structures, for instance an explanation of how certain views of a
cube enable one to see that it is a cube with an interior and with faces on the
far side, etc., then a mathematical formulation is inevitable. (N.B.
'Mathematical' does not mean 'numerical' or 'quantitative'.)
<p>
University courses in philosophy will need substantial
revision if the appropriate theory-building and theory-testing
skills are to be taught.
<p>
<a name="3.10."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
3.10. Conceptual developments in philosophy
</I>
</b></h3>
In philosophy as in science, attempting to explain things can
lead to new ways of looking at or thinking about the old facts,
and this requires new sets of concepts. For example, the
development of philosophical theories explaining the possibility of
various uses of language can lead to criticism of old
metalinguistic concepts or invention of new ones. Examples are:
Kant's distinction between 'a priori' and 'analytic'; Frege's
rejection of the subject/predicate distinction in favour of the
function/argument distinction for describing sentence
structures; the rejection by J.L. Austin and others of a four-fold
classification of sentences into statements, questions,
exclamations and imperatives; the discovery (explained, for instance,
by J. Kovesi in his <i>Moral Notions)</i> that 'evaluative' is not a
suitable label for the kinds of uses of language which have
attracted attention in moral philosophy and aesthetics;
modern criticisms of Kant's distinction between analytic and
synthetic statements; and Kuhn's attempt to replace the concept
'scientific theory' with 'paradigm'.
<p>
My own attempt (in
chapter 7) to replace crude distinctions between verbal and
nonverbal symbolisms and reasoning processes with more precise
distinctions is another example. My use of the concept of
'explaining how Xis possible' is another. Further examples
will be found in the chapter on numbers (chapter 8).
<p>
New concepts can change our view of what it is that we are
trying to explain, so that a new specification is given of the
old possibilities. Similar processes in the history of science
have been described by Kuhn (1962, pp. 129-134), such as
the change in the boundary between the concepts 'chemical
compound' and 'physical mixture' resulting from the atomic
theory of chemical composition.
<p>
In philosophy and in science, conceptual changes generate
new specifications of what needs to be explained, and so can
lead to new theories. The process of growth of human
knowledge seems to be full of 'feed back' loops.
<p>
<a name="3.11."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
3.11. The limits of possibilities
</I>
</b></h3>
I have said a lot about overlaps between aims of philosophy
and the first three aims of science, namely the discovery,
description, and explanation of possibilities. But science
attempts also to find limits of possibilities: laws of nature. Is
there a counterpart in philosophy?
<p>
Certainly some philosophers have tried to show not merely
how things are but also how they must be or cannot be.
Empiricists try to show that all significant knowledge <i>must</i>
be based on sensory experience. Rationalists try to show that
certain important kinds of knowledge <i>cannot</i> be empirical.
Dualists try to show that there <i>must</i> be more than a material
world if consciousness as we know it is possible. Logicists try
to argue that mathematical concepts <i>must</i> be definable in
<!-- page 79 -->
terms of logic, if they are to have their normal uses. Moral or
political philosophers often try to argue that their own moral
or political principles must be accepted if morality or society
is to be possible at all. Such theses are often based on attempts
at 'transcendental arguments', which I have already criticised
as over-ambitious, in the discussion of Kant, above.
<p>
Kant claimed to have unearthed various laws and principles
which were part of the fundamental constitution of the
human mind, so that all human thought and experience
necessarily had to conform to them. However, such claims are
very rash, in view of the fact that both biological and cultural
evolution are known to be possible. We have already seen that
thoughts that were impossible for ancient scientists are
possible for modern scientists. The same contrast can be made
between children and adults. This suggests that insofar as
human minds have a 'form' limiting the nature of the world
they experience, this form can vary from culture to culture
and from time to time in one culture or even in one person,
or robot.
<p>
The same is probably true of forms of language, society,
morals, religion and science. If there are limits to this
variation, they will have to be found by scientific investigations,
not introspection or philosophical argument. The limits can
hardly be studied before the mechanisms of individual and
social development are understood, however. We must not
try to fly before we can walk, even if we are philosophers.
<p>
However, there are many more mundane kinds of limits of
possibility which philosophers characteristically attend to in
their attempts to analyse familiar concepts. For instance, it is
impossible for someone to be a spinster and married; it is
impossible to admire someone for his honesty and breadth of
knowledge yet never believe a word he says; it is impossible
to be interested in botany yet never wish to look at or learn
anything about plants; it is impossible to be intensely angry
with someone yet not believe that person has done anything
you dislike or disapprove of; it is impossible to drive a car
with care and recklessly at the same time (though it is
possible carefully to drive over a cliff, to commit suicide). These
are not laws' limiting what is possible in the world. Rather,
they express defining conditions, or logical consequences of
defining conditions, for the use of our concepts. Kant called
such propositions 'analytic'.
<p>
<!-- page 80 -->
Making such 'definitional' necessities and impossibilities
explicit is part of the task of analysing how our concepts
work. This in turn is a useful means of drawing attention to
the presuppositions we all make about what sorts of things
are possible in the world, and about useful ways of
sub-dividing these possibilities. Looking at such subtle differences
as the difference between 'with care' and 'carefully' (which
are different since they have different boundaries) we learn
to articulate our implicit common-sense knowledge about
possible configurations of human beliefs, motives, decisions
and actions. This is a contribution of philosophy to
psychology and AI.
(See chapter 4 for more on this.)
<p>
The role of necessities and impossibilities in philosophy is
a large topic, and I have by no means exhausted it. All I
wanted to show here is that the scientific aim of discovering
limits of what is possible in the world is not an aim
philosophers can or should share unless they are prepared to go
beyond philosophical argument.
<p>
However, it is important for philosophers to expose present
limits of our conceptual and representational apparatus
often as a first step towards overcoming those limits. I am
trying to expose, and remove, limits of our normal ways of
thinking about philosophy and science.
<p>
<a name="3.12."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
3.12. Philosophy and technology
</I>
</b></h3>
A theory which explains old possibilities may have surprising
new implications. Technology includes the use of ingenuity
to invent previously unthought of possibilities which can be
explained by available theories. But this is also a major part
of pure science, as when the kinetic theory of heat explained
the possibility of a lowest temperature and the theory of
relativity was used to demonstrate and explain the previously
unsuspected possibility of conversion of mass into energy, and
of the bending of light by gravitation. The realisation of such
new kinds of possibilities in suitable experimental situations
can provide dramatic new support for the theories which
explain them. So can new ways of realising old possibilities.
Philosophical theorising can also lead to the invention of
possibilities previously unthought of and possible new means
of realising previously thought of situations. So philosophy,
like science, has its technological application.
<p>
For instance, philosophers have tried to use theories of
language to show the possibility of logical languages which in
one respect or another (e.g. precision, clarity, economy of
rules) improve on natural language, or social theories to
demonstrate the possibility of improving on existing social
structures, or epistemological theories to demonstrate the
possibility of improving on prevailing standards of rigour in
science or mathematics. Similarly there is a technological
theme to this book, insofar as it uses a theory of the relation
between philosophy and science in an attempt to show the
possibility of new types of collaboration between
philosophers and scientists who study man, or engineers who try to
design intelligent machines.
<p>

<a name="3.12."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
3.12. Laws in philosophy and the human sciences
</I>
</b></h3>
I have tried to show that philosophy and science have
overlapping interests, and partially similar methodologies, and
that philosophy can generate science. The affinities between
science and philosophy seem to be strongest in the case of
the sciences which study man. For it is unlikely that these
sciences will, in the foreseeable future, go beyond theories
which describe and explain possibilities (the things people
and social systems can do).
<p>
It seems very unlikely that they will discover new laws
with predictive content and explanations of those laws, apart
from such trivial laws as are based on common sense, such as
the law' that no normal person in our culture calmly invites
a total stranger to chop his leg off! Some alleged laws are
very likely to be culture-bound regularities, modifiable by
training, propaganda, or economic pressures. Other apparent
laws 'discovered' by empirical research are in fact just
disguised tautologies, true by definition, for instance: 'Other
things being equal, people tend to choose alternatives which
they believe will bring about what they desire most'; or
'Persons are more likely to believe a statement if it is made
by someone they respect, other things being equal'.
<p>
But the lack of substantial laws does not leave the human
sciences without content, for there are many kinds of social
and psychological phenomena whose <i>possibility</i> is well
known and needs to be explained, even though the prediction
and explanation <i>of particular instances</i> is out of the
question,
since it depends enormously on highly complex individual
<!-- page 82 -->
histories, decision-strategies, beliefs, interests, hopes, fears,
ways of looking at things, and so on.
<p>
To turn to the search for <i>probabilistic</i> or <i>statistical</i> laws,
when the hope of <i>universal</i> laws has been abandoned, as so
often happens, is to reject the opportunity to study and
interpret the rich structure of particular cases as a way of
finding out what possibilities they exemplify.
<p>
Insofar as there are laws and regularities to be discerned
among all the idiosyncracies of human behaviour, they can
hardly be understood and explained before the possibilities
they limit have been described and explained. Outside novels,
there are so far few, if any, rich and systematic descriptions
or explanations of human possibilities, so the human sciences
will need to join forces with philosophy in the study of
possibilities for some time yet.
<p>
<a name="3.14."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
3.14. The contribution of Artificial Intelligence
</I>
</b></h3>
But not only with philosophy, for in the new discipline of
artificial intelligence theories are emerging, in the form of
specifications for computer programs, which, for the first
time, begin to approach the complexity and generative power
needed for the description and explanation of intelligent
behaviour while also accounting for immense individual
differences (as pointed out by Clowes, in 'Man the creative
machine').
<p>
When such theories are embedded in computers and shown
by the behaviour of the computer actually to work, then this
establishes that they do not rest on presuppositions of the type
they are trying to explain. (However, at present, A.I. models
explain only a very tiny fragment of what needs to be explained.)
<p>
It may turn out that the combination of skills and
knowledge required to construct non-circular and rigorous
explanations of any significant range of human possibilities cannot
exist in any one scientist nor in any team of scientists,
philosophers, and engineers, small enough to co-operate. Human
possibilities may be too complex to be understood and
explained by humans. But the time is not yet ripe for drawing
this pessimistic conclusion, and even if it is true, that is no
reason for not trying.
<p>
<a name="3.15."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
3.15. Conclusion
</I>
</b></h3>
The best way to make substantial new progress with old
philosophical problems about mind and body, about perception,
knowledge, language, logic, mathematics, science and
aesthetics, is to reformulate them in the context of an attempt
to explain the possibility of a mind. The best way to do this
is to attempt to <i>design</i> a working mind, i.e. a mechanism
which can perceive, think, remember, learn, solve problems,
interpret symbols or representations, use language, act on the
basis of multiple motives, and so on.
<p>
Computers cannot yet do these things in a way which
compares with humans, and perhaps they never will. But
computer programs provide the only currently available language
for formulating rigorous and testable theories about such
processes. And only with the aid of computers can we explore
the power of really complex and intricate theories. (Part two
of this book elaborates on the kind of complexity involved.)
So I conclude that in order to make real advances in problem
areas mentioned above, philosophers, like psychologists and
linguists, will need to learn about developments in the design
of computing systems, programming languages and artificial
intelligence models, even if they do not write programs
themselves.
<p>
The ('meta-level') concepts
<I>used for describing</I> computing systems, programming languages,
hardware and software architectures, etc. are as important as, or
perhaps even more important than the concepts <I>used in</I> programming
languages.
<p>
The attempt to design a mind is a very long term research
enterprise. I expect that it will provide the best illustration of
the overlap between science and philosophy.

<I>
4.1. Introduction
</I>
</b></h3>
Elsewhere in this book, I have frequently referred to an
activity of philosophers known as conceptual analysis. This
has been practised in various forms and for various purposes
by a wide range of philosophers and scientists. It has been
particularly associated with mid-twentieth-century philosophy
in Oxford and Cambridge, for instance the work of L.
Wittgenstein, J. Wisdom, J.L. Austin and G. Ryle. As I see it,
the main difference between these and earlier philosophers is
that the latter were somewhat less self-conscious about the
activity. However, on the whole recent analysts agree with
previous philosophers that the main function of conceptual
analysis is to help clarify or resolve philosophical problems,
and occasionally also to provide a basis for criticising some
uses of language. For example, in <i>A Plea for Excuses</i> Austin
claimed that the analysis of the concepts <i>reason, excuse, justification,</i> and related concepts would not only help to
clarify philosophical problems about freedom but also show
some errors in the utterances of judges and in writings on
jurisprudence.
<p>
I have tried to suggest that, besides these uses, conceptual
analysis has another important purpose, namely to find out
things about people and the world. However, this requires a
far more disciplined and systematic approach to the analysis
of concepts than is to be found in the work of most
philosophers. (This is partly because their goals are different.)
<p>
We have a very rich and subtle collection of concepts for
talking about mental states and processes and social
interactions, including: <i>abdicate, abhor, acquiesce, adultery, adore, admire, angry, astonish, attend</i> and <i>avid,</i> to
mention a few.
<p>
These have evolved over thousands of years, and they are
learnt and tested by individuals in the course of putting them
to practical use, in interacting with other people,
understanding gossip, making sense of behaviour, and even in
organising
their own thoughts and actions.
<p>
All concepts are theory-laden, and the same is true of these
concepts. In using them we are unwittingly making use of
elaborate theories about language, mind and society. The
concepts could not be used so successfully in intricate
inter-personal processes if they were not based on substantially
true theories. So by analysing the concepts, we may hope to
learn a great deal about the human mind and about our own
society. This point does not seem to be widely understood:
this is why so many people (including many philosophy
students) dismiss conceptual analysis as being 'merely concerned
with meanings of words'.
<p>
Most of the theoretical presuppositions of our ordinary
concepts are not concerned with laws or regularities, but with
possibilities. For example, the use of a concept like <i>careful</i> is
based on our knowledge that people can act in certain ways,
not on any laws about how they always or usually act. The
chapter on the mechanism of mind outlines some results of
my own attempts to analyse familiar concepts concerned with
actions and related mental processes. These analyses revealed
a host of human possibilities, and the mechanism sketched in
that chapter is intended to provide the beginnings of an
explanation of those possibilities, showing how conceptual
analysis can contribute to psychology and artificial
intelligence.
<p>
Similarly, by analysing concepts related to space and
physical motion, e.g. <i>bigger, longer, inside, push, pull, carry, fetch, throw, impede, collide,</i> and so on, we may expose some
unarticulated theories about our physical environment which
govern much of our thought and behaviour. This task is not
so urgent because physics and geometry have already made a
great deal of progress, often going beyond our common-sense
theories. To some extent this has been a result of conceptual
analysis: the most striking example being Einstein's analysis
of concepts of space and time. However, further conceptual
analysis is required for improving our understanding not of
the physical world itself, but of how people of various ages
and cultures think about the world (consciously and unconsciously).
Intelligent machines may need to think of the world as ordinary people
do, rather than as quantum physicists do.
[Note added: 2001. The recent growth of interest in the study of
ontologies in AI and software engineering illustrates this point.]
<p>
It has been easier to make substantial progress in the
physical sciences partly because the physical world is much simpler
than the world of mental and social processes. Moreover, our
interactions with the physical world are not as rich as our
interactions with people so there is more scope for
commonsense to have evolved mistaken theories about matter.
<p>
In the rest of this chapter, I shall try to list some of the
methods which are useful in analysing concepts. Most of this
will be familiar to analytic philosophers, especially those who
have studied the work of Austin and Wittgenstein. However,
<p>
I have found that the techniques are very hard to teach, and
hope that by formulating these procedures, I may help both
to clarify how the method works and to provide beginners
with a basis for developing the skills involved.
<p>
I can only list some techniques for collecting 'reminders'
about how our concepts work. The task of organising and
explaining the phenomena by means of some kind of
generative theory is very difficult. It is similar to the construction
of scientific theories. I do not claim to be able to teach people
how to be good scientists. (That will have to wait until we
have computer programs which behave like good creative
scientists, when we shall be in a better position to think about
what it is to teach someone to be a scientist!) What follows is
merely a sketch, with a few hints. The topic deserves a whole
book, and should be susceptible of a better organised
presentation than I can manage.

<h3><b>
<I>
4.2. Strategies in conceptual analysis
</I>
</b></h3>
When trying to analyse a concept (e.g. <i>knowledge, truth, emotion, imagination, physical object),</i> some or all
of the
following moves may be helpful.
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Collect descriptions of varied instances of the concept,
and also descriptions of non-instances which are similar
in some ways to instances. For example, consider the
following examples of imagining something: imagining
that the Conservatives will win the next election,
imagining that you are very rich, imagining that you are falling
off a cliff, imagining that there's a donkey in front of
you, imagining that time travel will occur one day,
imagining that 39875 is the largest possible number. Do
these have anything in common? How do they relate to
utterances like 'I can't imagine what she sees in him', 'He's
a very imaginative dancer', etc. How do they differ? How
do they differ from remembering something, learning
something, believing something, reading about something,
expecting something, planning, and dreaming? Try to
formulate rules or definitions which will sort candidates
into instances and non-instances, and test your rules or
definitions on those previously collected. Try to test them
more thoroughly by searching for new difficult cases
(which friends and colleagues may be more likely to
provide since they will not be committed to your definitions.)
<p>
<li>Try criticising and extending the definitions given in
dictionaries. Dictionary writers are not normally trained in
conceptual analysis, and may make mistakes. Moreover,
the aim of a dictionary definition is not to explain how a
concept works (e.g. what knowledge is presupposed by its
use and how it is related to a family of concepts). Rather,
the aim is merely to enable someone who already grasps
the concept to attach a label to it. So dictionary
definitions are usually much too brief and simple to be very
useful for analysis of concepts. This comes out most
clearly in the attempt to program computers to
understand natural language: for such a purpose each word
needs to be associated with much more elaborate rules for
its use than will normally be found in a dictionary entry.
In spite of this, dictionary entries may be good starting
points when you are short of ideas.
<p>
<li>Using a dictionary, and Roget's <i>Thesaurus,</i> try to collect
lists of related words and phrases: analyses of different
items in the same list will probably illuminate each other.
<p>
For example, if analysing the concept <i>imagine,</i> look also
at <i>image, imagination, suppose, consider, think, think about, think of, visualise, remember, invent, refer to, have</i>
<i>in mind, . . .</i> Similarly, in analysing the
concept <i>know,</i> we
would need to look at <i>notice, discover, learn, believe, accept, understand, remember, forget, infer, evidence,</i>
<i>reason, test, proof,</i> and many more. Having found some
related but different concepts, try to find examples which
illustrate one concept but not the other, and vice versa.
<p>
Try to work out why each example fits one concept but
not the other(s). For example, search for examples of
knowing X without believing X, or examples of believing
X without knowing X. (See Austin's use of examples to
analyse the difference between 'by mistake' and 'by
accident' in <i>'A Plea for Excuses'.</i> My
chapter on the
mechanism of mind was based on an attempt to extend his work.)
<p>

<li>Try to collect lists grouped in different ways. For instance,
one list given above included mental states and processes
related to imagining. Another list would involve <i>uses</i> to
which imagining may be put, for example, drawing
something, solving a problem, trying to recall exactly what
happened, entertaining people, anticipating difficulties
while making plans, etc. One can then ask how it is
possible for the process to be used in these various ways.
<p>
This calls for a collection of examples of each kind of
use to be thought about carefully, with a view to
postulating some underlying mechanism. Another list might
include a range of different kinds of things we can imagine
(a visual scene, hearing a tune, doing something, a war
starting, a mathematical theorem being false, etc.). (One
of the things people find hard to learn is the technique of
generating examples of things they already know about,
including words and phrases. Wittgenstein was a master at
this, though he was not very good at analysing the
similarities and differences between the examples.)
<p>
<li>There is a collection of very general categories we use in
much of our thought and language, such as: event, act,
state of affairs, process, disposition, ability, regularity,
cause, explanation, function, object, property, relation,
etc. (For example, if you find odd the assertion that
apples hang on trees very slowly, this is because you
(perhaps unconsciously) recognise that hanging is a <i>state</i>
whereas 'slowly' can describe only <i>processes,</i> like growing.)
<p>
Try fitting these categories to the lists of related concepts,
to help bring out differences between them.
For example, learning something is a process, knowing or
believing something a state one is in (perhaps resulting
from such a process). Believing something is a state
involving a property of oneself, whereas knowing something
involves an extra relation to the world (e.g. getting
something right). Since knowing something is a state not an
event (contrast learning, or discovering, or noticing), those
philosophers and psychologists who refer to 'the act of
knowing' are either revealing their inability to analyse their
own concepts, or else using technical jargon which is
bound to cause confusion because of superficial
resemblances to concepts from our ordinary language. (I do not
wish to deny that ordinary language is itself sometimes
muddled.)
<p>
Some mental states, for example, believing that there is a
tiger in the next room, can explain behaviour, such as
running away, but do not involve an ability or any disposition
to behave. However, the combination of the belief and
another state, such as fear of tigers, may generate a
disposition to lock doors, run away, or call for help,
depending on circumstances. Some states, for example, knowing
how to count, involve an ability which may or may not
ever be manifested in behaviour, whereas others, for
example, being an enthusiast (e.g. about golf, gardening,
or Greek sculpture), involve a tendency or even a regularity
in behaviour.
'He smokes' reports a habit which is manifested (much to
the annoyance of many non-smokers), whereas 'he would
like to smoke' reports an inclination which may be
successfully suppressed forever, so that there need not be
any behavioural manifestations.
<p>
Desiring and wanting are states, whereas deliberating is a
process, and deciding an event which terminates such a
process and initiates a state of being decided.
<p>
Very often noun phrases look as if they denote objects,
whereas analysis shows that they do not. Having an image
is being in a certain mental state. The state may explain
various abilities or actions. Some people think of an image
as an object which is somehow involved in the state of
having an image much as a nose is involved in the state of
having a nose. However, it may be that this is not how the
concept works, and that to talk of the image is merely a
short-hand and indirect way of talking about a very
complex mental state: when we say that a house has a shape
we are not saying that besides the house there is some
other object, its shape; rather we are alluding to an aspect
of the state of the house, namely how all its parts are
related to one another.
<p>
Similarly if someone has a visual
image: this is a matter of being in a state in which one is
able to do a variety of things which one can normally do
only when there is something one can see. It does not
follow that the image is some kind of object like a picture
though no doubt, as with all mental states and
processes, there is some kind of symbolism used (probably
unconsciously) to represent the thing imagined. (For
more on this see Pylyshyn, <i>'What the mind's eye tells the mind's brain").</i>
<p>

<li>For each concept being investigated ask whether it refers
to a <i>specific</i> kind of thing (event, state, disposition, etc.),
or whether it covers a whole lot of different kinds of
examples, in which case it <i>is polymorphous</i> (Ryle, <i>The Concept of Mind).</i> For example, the polymorphous
concept <i>motive</i> covers desires, purposes, attitudes, attempts
to achieve something, attempts to prevent or avoid
something, and perhaps character traits ('the motive was
greed'). If the concept covers many different sorts of
cases, this is rarely simply because the word is simply
ambiguous. So you can then ask why all these cases are
grouped under a common description: do they fulfil a
common function? do they have a common explanation?
do they have a common relationship to some other
things?
<br>
[NOTE: 7 Feb 2017]
<br>
This idea was extended to include "Parametric polymorphism" in
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/family-resemblance-vs-polymorphism.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/family-resemblance-vs-polymorphism.html</a>
<p>
For example, motives have in common the fact that
(when combined with beliefs) they can <i>explain</i> decisions,
intentions, and behaviour. But this shifts the burden to
the concept <i>explain,</i> or <i>explanation',</i> why are there so
many different sorts of things we call explanations, and
do they have anything significant in common? (An
important and still open research question.)
<i>Careful</i> is another example of a polymorphous concept:
different sorts of things are involved in careful driving,
careful teaching, careful selection of words in an essay,
careful breaking of sad news, careful cleaning of a
precious vase, etc. Here it is relatively easy to see what is
in common to all these cases, namely reference to goals,
possible undesirable occurrences, a collection of risks or
dangers, paying attention to the risks, and doing whatever
is required to minimise them.
<p>

<li>If the concept appears to be polymorphous, ask whether
there are some 'central' and some 'peripheral' or 'derivative' cases,
and try to account for the difference. For
example, describing a person as 'moody' or 'unco-operative' seems to be
central compared with describing a
car that way. Ask what distinguishes central from
peripheral or metaphorical cases: is it a difference in the number
of preconditions satisfied? If so, why does the concept
have those preconditions? What is their point?
<p>

<li>Ask what the role of the concept is in our culture. Is it
merely a convenient descriptive symbol? If so, why should
we want to describe those things? Does it have some
non-descriptive function? For example, does it express
approval? Is its use characteristically abusive, or a means
of showing off? Is it part of a system of concepts whose
use depends on the existence of some kind of social
institution? What is the point of the institution? For example,
is it used to apportion blame or responsibility in order to
decide questions of redress? What would it be like to live
in a culture without that institution? Is there some aspect
of the concept which would remain usable without that
institution?
<p>
Examples of concepts which seem to depend on more or
less complex social institutions are: courage, dignity,
disapproval, honour, shame, embarrassment, owning, owing,
impertinence and gallantry. Wittgenstein (in his
<i>Philosophical Investigations)</i> and his followers have argued that
very many mental concepts, including 'following a rule', are
essentially social. I think that they exaggerate because of
their ignorance of possible computational models of
mental processes.

<p>
<li>Ask what sorts of things can be explained by instances of
the concept. Does it explain events, processes, states,
abilities, non-occurrences, the loss of an ability, success,
failure, a single occurrence, a number of occurrences, etc.?
<p>
For example, knowledge explains (or is able to explain)
success; fatigue and confusion explain failure; desire
explains attempts.
<p>
Does the explanation function as a cause, an enabling
condition, a purpose, a justification, an excuse, a
mechanism, a law, or what?

<p>
<li>Ask the following range of questions about instances of
the concept under investigation.
<p>
<blockquote>
1. What sorts of things can bring them about?
<br>
2. What sorts of things can prevent them?
<br>
3. What sorts of things can facilitate their occurrence?
<br>
4. What can cause variations in the instances?
<br>
5. What sorts of effects can they have?
</blockquote>
<p>
Sometimes it is possible to distinguish 'standard' from
'non-standard' causes, effects, etc. For example, there is
something irrational about beliefs which are caused by
desires ('wishful thinking') but not about actions caused
by desires. (Why?)
<p>
Sometimes it is useful to distinguish events and processes
a person can bring about from those which merely happen.
You can decide to stop walking or trying to find
something out, but you cannot decide to stop knowing or
believing something. You can decide to try to get
something, but you cannot decide to want it. Why not?
(Answering this question would extend the theory of
chapter 6.)

<p>
<li>If you have managed to collect a number of examples of
related concepts, see if you can find a set of relatively
'primitive' concepts and relations, which can be used to
generate a lot of the examples, by being combined in
different ways. (That is try to find a 'grammar' for the
phenomena.) This is a useful first step towards building a
good theory of how the concepts work, as opposed to
merely describing lots of facts about their relations.
<p>
Linguists are increasingly trying to do this  though it is
not clear how far they appreciate the intimate connection
between the study of our language and the study of our
world.
<p>
For example, the verbs of motion mentioned earlier all
seem to involve a subset of the following ideas:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Something has a position which changes.
<p>
<li>Something is an agent (it may or may not also change
position, and may or may not change the position of
other objects).
<p>
<li>There is a route for the motion of each object, with a
starting and a finishing location.
<p>
<li>Something may be an instrument, used by an agent,
possibly to move an object.
<p>
<li>Moving things have absolute and relative speeds.
<p>
<li>If A causes B to move, A may be on the side away
from which B is moving or on the side of B to which
it is moving.
<p>
<li>The movement of B may merely be initiated by A
(pushing something over the edge of a table) or may
be entirely due to A (throwing something, pushing it
along).
<p>
<li>The agent may have a purpose in moving the object.
<p>
<li>There may be a previous history of movements or
locations referred to (e.g. if A retrieves B).
<p>
<li>There may be more than one stage in the motion
(e.g. A fetches B).
<p>
<li>A may do to B something which tends to produce
motion, but the motion may be resisted, e.g. pushing
an object which is too heavy, pulling an object with
a string which stretches or breaks.
<p>
<li>The agent may also be the supporter of the object
moved, e.g. in carrying it, or may be supported by it,
e.g. in riding it.
</ol>
<p>
Different combinations of these (and other) ideas can be
used to generate whole families of related concepts, often
including concepts for which we do not (yet?) have labels.
For example, I do not think English contains a word
which refers to a process in which an agent A carries an
agent B to some location, and then A picks up some
object and is carried, by B, back to the starting point.
<p>
Perhaps this is an important part of some social activity
in some other culture. Some sort of obstacle race?
<p>
The 'primitive' ideas used as the basis for generating such
a family of related concepts may themselves be
susceptible of further analysis. Moreover, some concepts require
mutually recursive definitions: for example, <i>believe</i> and
<i>desire</i> cannot be defined independently of each other.
<p>
The sort of analysis suggested here for concepts of motion
is now familiar to linguists and people working in artificial
intelligence (for example Schank and Abelson, who also
explore analogies between such physical processes and
mental processes  like communicating information. See
Bibliography.)
<p>
Similarly, in analysing a concept like <i>know,</i> or <i>knowledge,</i>
it will be necessary to distinguish a variety of elements
and relations which can enter into scenarios involving
knowledge. A person (or other knower) will be involved,
as will things in the world about which something is
known. There will be a state of mind of the person, in
which some aspects of the things and their relationships
will be represented, that is, a belief is involved, though
not necessarily consciously. There will be something
which gives rise to the belief, either at the time the
person knows or at some earlier time, for example, a process
of perceiving something, doing an experiment or test, or
perhaps acquiring the information indirectly from other
knowers, or inferring it from some other knowledge.
<p>
There will be a relation between the source of the belief
and the belief which certifies or justifies the belief (e.g.
the evidence is good evidence). There may be sentences,
spoken, uttered, or merely thought, which state whatever
it is that is known, and in that case the sentences can be
decomposed (usually) into fragments with different
relations both to items in the world and aspects of the
knower's mind. There may or may not be <i>uses</i> to which
the knowledge is put, including answering questions,
interpreting one's experiences, making plans, acting in the
world, understanding other people's sentences,
formulating new questions, etc. (Again, study of a system of
concepts from ordinary language can contribute to psychology,
and to the attempt to design artificial minds.)
<p>
In two papers on <i>ought, better</i> and related concepts (1969
and 1970), I have tried to show how a variety of uses can
be generated in a fairly systematic fashion. Similarly,
much important work in the development of mathematics,
for instance Euclid's, and later Hilbert's, work on the
foundations of geometry can be seen as a form of
conceptual analysis, though usually of a very reductive sort
(that is many concepts and theorems are reduced to a
very small number).

<p>
<li>When analysing a concept it may be helpful to try to list
ways in which one can teach a young child or a foreigner
learning one's language, how the concept works. What
sorts of examples would make good illustrations, and
why? What sorts of things would be worth mentioning as
<i>not</i> being examples, and why are they likely to be
confused? What sorts of things need not be mentioned because
they can be taken for granted? Why? What would Martians
have to be like in order to be capable of learning the
concept?

<p>
<li>Try to list ways in which you can test the truth or falsity
of statements involving the concepts in question, including
cases which might be difficult. For example, how do we
decide whether a person has a certain attitude, such as
anti-semitism? Is asking the person an adequate test?
<p>
When is it adequate and when not? What patterns of
behaviour are adequate tests? Are they <i>decisive,</i> or are
they merely <i>indicative?</i> Why? Are there some situations in
which no decisive test is possible, so that doubts cannot
be removed? For example, a racialist who has excellent
motives for concealing his attitude, and who is an
excellent actor. (As we shall see later on, there is no reason to
suppose that there should be behavioural tests for all
internal computational states and processes, either in a
computer or in a person or animal.)

<p>
<li>Sometimes it is useful to ask whether being in a certain
state presupposes having some knowledge, or exercising
some intellectual ability. For example emotions like
surprise, dismay, embarrassment, shyness and humiliation
presuppose a lot of knowledge. You can long for your
mother only if you know you have one, know she is not
present, and can imagine a possible state of affairs in
which the two of you are together. Can a goldfish long for
its mother? If not, why not?
<p>
The widespread belief within our culture that intellectual
and emotional phenomena are quite disparate can be
refuted by detailed conceptual analysis.

<p>
<li>Often some question about the analysis of a concept can
be investigated by telling elaborate stories about imaginary
situations. So science-fiction writers are good sources of
material for this activity. For example, imagine a time
when machines are available which will make a complete
copy of a human body (including the state of the brain),
except that cancer cells are replaced with healthy cells.
<p>
Suppose that in such a society it is commonplace for
incurable cancer sufferers to agree to have their bodies
copied by this machine, while under total anaesthetic,
followed by cremation of the cancer-ridden body. The
new one is allowed to take its place  so people come
home from hospital saying I'm glad to be back, and I feel
much better now that I've got my new body'. In such a
society is our concept 'murder' applicable to their
treatment? Is the concept 'same person' applicable to the
person who goes into the hospital and the person who comes
out? (For more on this see my 'New bodies for sick
persons'.)
<p>
Another example: people disagree over whether it is
essential to the concept 'emotion' that emotions involve
felt bodily changes. One way of convincing yourself that
such physiological processes are not essential is to imagine
a society of Martians who are very much like us with very
similar sorts of social institutions and similar ways of
seeing, thinking, and acting, but who do not have the bodily
reactions which we (or some of us) feel in certain
emotional states. So they have hopes, disappointments,
pleasant and unpleasant surprises, they feel pity, loneliness,
dismay when their plans go wrong, they are anxious when
there is a high probability of things going wrong, they are
proud of their achievements, envious of others who are
more successful, greedy for wealth, and so on. By
describing the behaviour and social interactions of such beings in
great detail, and imagining what it would be like to
communicate with them, you should be able to convince
yourself that you would find it perfectly natural to use
our emotion concepts in talking about their mental states.
<p>
You would say 'He's terribly embarrassed about the
attention he's getting', even though he feels no hot flush
in the cheeks or any other physiological change
characteristic of embarrassment in humans.
<p>
Of course, this sort of investigation does not produce
knock-down arguments, because people can differ in how
their concepts work. For example, mathematicians use a
concept of <i>ellipse</i> which includes circles, whereas for
non-mathematicians a necessary condition for something being
an ellipse is that it has major and minor axes of differing
lengths. Similarly, there may be some people for whom
the accompanying physiological changes are necessary
conditions for the applicability of concepts like <i>envy,
embarrassment, loneliness,</i> etc. However, what one can
demonstrate to such people is that by insisting on these
necessary conditions they are making it impossible for
themselves to describe situations which might one day
arise, without inventing a whole lot of new terminology
which may prove very hard to teach. Whereas I would
claim that my use of the non-physiological concept of
emotion in no way interferes with my communication
with other people, and allows me the power to read
science fiction without any feeling of linguistic distortion.

<p>
<li>Try to test your theories by expressing them in some kind
of computer program or at least in a sketch for a design
of a working program. For example, try to design a
program which can communicate with people using the
concepts. If you have analysed the concepts wrongly then
this will show up in some failures of communication
between the computer and people (just as the
misunderstandings of children and other learners show up). Or test
your analysis by designing a program whose behaviour is
intended to <i>instantiate</i> the concept, then see whether the
actual behaviour is aptly described using the concepts in
question. You will usually find that you have failed to
capture some of the richness of the concept. For example,
for a while some people hoped that programs written in
the language PLANNER would capture the essence of the
concept of a goal, or purpose. But the behaviour of the
programs clearly quashed this hope. (E.g. see Winograd,
1972.)
<p>
Of course, sometimes a little
thought makes this
elaborate kind of test unnecessary. Nevertheless, the
methods of A.I. provide a useful extension to previous
techniques of conceptual analysis, by exposing unnoticed
gaps in a theory and by permitting thorough and rapid
testing of very complex analyses.
</ol>
<p>

This account of conceptual analysis is by no means
complete. For more detailed examples, refer to the writings of
philosophers mentioned and also A.R. White's <i>Attention,</i> and
his contribution to <i>Owl of Minerva,</i> (ed. Bontempo and
Odell), and Margaret Boden's <i>Purposive Explanation in
Psychology.</i> Philosophers usually do not pay enough attention
to problems of describing mental processes. Neither do they
normally attempt the kind of system-building involved in
designing a 'grammar' for a collection of concepts in the
manner hinted at above. For instance, is there some sort of
grammar for concepts related to attention? In other words, is
there a relatively small subset of concepts in terms of which
all the others can be defined? I believe the answer is 'Yes'
but to establish this will require designing a fairly detailed
model of a person, capable of generating a large number of
processes involving perception, deliberation, reasoning,
planning, problem-solving, and execution of plans and intentions.
Some small steps in this direction are taken in
<a href="#chap6">Chapter 6</a>, which proposes some minimal
architectural requirements for a human-like system.
<p>
Despite my disparaging remarks about philosophers, there
have been some profoundly important systematic analyses,
mostly produced by philosophers of logic and mathematics,
such as Frege, Russell, Tarski and Prior. For example, Frege's
analyses of concepts like <i>all, some, nobody,</i> and related
quantifiers, led to a revolution in logic and has profoundly
influenced the development of computer programming
languages used in artificial intelligence (via the work of
Alonzo Church). Austin's <i>How to do Things with Words</i> is
another example of a philosopher's attempt at detailed and
systematic analysis, which has made a great impact on
linguistics and more recently on AI.
<p>
If only Wittgenstein, in his
later writings and teaching,
had not made such a virtue of his inability to construct
systematic theories integrating the results of his analyses, a
whole generation of philosophers might have been far more
disciplined and productive.
<p>
Of course, there are dangers in insisting on everything
being formalised and systematic. Much shallow theorising is a
result of trying to fit very complex and messy structures into
a neat and simple formal system. A well known example of
the distorting effect of formalisation is the claim that the
logical connectives of propositional calculus adequately
represent the words 'and', 'not', 'or', 'if', etc. of ordinary
language. However, even if this claim is false, it remains true
that the formalisation provided a basis for deeper exploration
than was previously possible. For example, by describing
exactly how the use of the ordinary words deviates from the
truth-functional symbols, we obtain useful descriptions of
how they work. (See Gazdar and Pullum 1977.) The same can
be said of some other systematic but inaccurate analyses.
<p>
The two extremes to be avoided are demanding
formalisation of everything at all costs, and rejecting formalisation
because some of our concepts are too complex and
unsystematic in their behaviour for us to be able to represent them in
elegant formal systems. One of the great advantages of using
programming languages for formulating analyses of concepts
(as Winograd did  see his 1973), is that programming
languages are well suited to include many tests for special
cases and exceptions to general rules. It is much harder to use
formal grammars, or axiomatic systems, for this purpose.
<a name="4.3."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
4.3. The importance of conceptual analysis
</I>
</b></h3>
The activity of attempting to analyse families of related
concepts can be enjoyable and interesting in its own right.
Discussion of similarities and differences between <i>fetch, retrieve, carry,</i> and related concepts is the sort of thing even a child
can find good fun  though getting the analysis right is not
child's play. But besides giving intellectual pleasure, the
activity may have a useful function. For example, it is well
known that many perennial philosophical problems arise out
of confused reflections on things we all know, and that at
least some of these problems can be solved or dissolved with
the aid of conceptual analysis. I think it can also be shown
that a great many debates on ethical and political issues, such
as debates about the justifiability of abortion, about equality
of educational opportunity, and about what sorts of
decision-making procedures are democratic, are often more confused
than necessary either because the participants are using
concepts in a muddled fashion or because they are to some
extent at cross purposes because of subtle differences in the
ways their concepts work. In either case progress can be
made if people learn how to analyse their own and other
people's concepts.
<p>
Conceptual analysis can play a role in science and
mathematics too. I have already mentioned Einstein's work
involving analyses of concepts like <i>simultaneous,</i> and other
spatial
and temporal relations. Another example is the struggle by
mathematicians of previous centuries to clarify the concepts
<i>infinite</i> and <i>infinitesimal,</i> leading to the discovery of the
concept of a limit, and to formal set theory.
<p>
Every science will have at its frontiers concepts which are
to some extent in need of analysis and possibly improvement.
Not all the problems of science are to be solved simply by
collecting new facts, or by using existing terminology to build
new theories. In the mature sciences, the concepts most in
need of analysis will usually be highly technical, remote from
the concepts of ordinary language.
<p>
However, in the social sciences and psychology, and
increasingly in artificial intelligence,
concepts from ordinary language play a central role in the
construction of new theories and in the description of
phenomena to be explained. Thus it is important for
practitioners of these disciplines to be sensitive to the need for
analysis, and to be skilful at doing it.
<p>
The dangers of failing to analyse concepts properly can be illustrated
by a few rather extreme examples. Someone who had not seen how
the concept <i>bachelor</i> worked might think it interesting to do a survey
to find our what proportion of the bachelors in some social group
were unmarried. He would probably get no support from research
councils. However, less obvious mistakes of the same sort could pass
unnoticed, like attempts to test the hypothesis that <i>other things being equal</i> people tend to believe things which are asserted by
those
they respect, or the hypothesis that <i>other things being equal</i> people
tend to try to achieve goals they think they can achieve, or the
hypothesis that being embarrassed involves believing that other
people are paying attention to you. Of course, such research goals
would usually be disguised in obfuscating jargon, but that does not
reduce the need for conceptual analysis. I once read a research
proposal which looked very impressive until the English equivalent to
the jargon emerged. The aim was to find out whether people tend,
on the whole, to co-operate more successfully if they get on well
together. (For some similar criticisms of Social Science, see Andreski,
<i>Social Science as Sorcery.)</i>
<p>
An example of an important piece of
biological theorising whose concepts cry out for detailed analysis can
be
found in Dawkins' <i>The Selfish Gene.</i>
<p>
Besides the role of conceptual analysis in preventing
muddled thinking and silly research, there is another
important role in relation to science, namely making explicit some
of what we already know, clearly a useful preliminary to
attempts to add to what we know. I believe this is especially
useful in fields like developmental psychology and
anthropology, concerned with the study of ways of thinking and
learning. Previously I listed some concepts concerned with
spatial movement and indicated how one might begin to
analyse some of the more complex ideas in terms of
combinations of relatively primitive ones. Very young children
somehow acquire both the relatively 'primitive' concepts and
also a variety of complex combinations of these. It is not
thought to be beyond them to grasp the difference between
'fetch' and 'send for'  expressions which occur in familiar
nursery rhymes. By studying these concepts we can define
some of the tasks of psychology. An adequate theory of
learning must account for a child's ability to master these
ideas. Even very young children are capable of grasping quite
abstract rules, including rules which they cannot formulate in
words. For example, a three-year-old reacted to his older
brother's use of 'nope' for 'no', by starting to say not only
'nope' but also 'yesp', 'okayp' and 'thankyoup'. Try
formulating the rule he had invented!
(Do developmental psychologists, or brain scientists,
have any convincing explanation of the ability to
learn these things?)
<p>
By improving our understanding of what it is that our
children have to learn we may perhaps come to understand better
not only how they learn, but also what sorts of things can go
wrong with the learning process, and perhaps even what can
be done about it. How many teachers in schools, colleges and
universities have sufficient skill in conceptual analysis to be
able to discern subtle differences between the concepts they
are trying to teach and the concepts so far grasped by their
pupils?
<p>
Other social sciences can also benefit from conceptual
analysis. By doing this sort of analysis for concepts used in
several different cultures, anthropologists and sociologists
could enhance their studies of what is common and what
varies among different modes of thinking and reasoning.
<p>
I have already alluded several times to the role of
conceptual analysis in the work reported in this book. Several
chapters are based in part on attempts at analysing familiar
concepts. But most of the work is still sketchy and makes use of
concepts which themselves require further study.
<p>
<a href="#chap2">The chapter on the aims of science</a>,
for example, makes liberal use of a
very complex concept which still requires further analysis,
namely the concept of what is <i>possible.</i> Several other
concepts used in that chapter are equally in need of further
investigation.
<p>
<a href="#chap7">The chapter on analogical representations</a>
attempts to analyse a familiar distinction between different
sorts of symbolisms, or representations, showing that the
verbal/pictorial distinction is usually misdescribed and that
there are actually several different distinctions where at first
there seems to be only one.
<p>
<a href="#chap8">The chapter on learning about numbers</a> begins to analyse
some of our simplest number concepts, drawing attention to complexities in what
a child has to learn which are not normally noticed.
<p>
<a href="#chap9">The chapter on computer vision</a>,
and the ensuing discussion includes some small steps towards
clarifying a collection of familiar concepts like <i>conscious, interest, experience.</i>
<p>
Nearly all of this work is incomplete, and will remain incomplete for many
years. But, as I have suggested in this chapter and will try to substantiate
later, the methodology of artificial intelligence will be a major spur to
progress.

CHAPTER 5
</b></h2>
<h2><b>
ARE COMPUTERS REALLY RELEVANT?
</b></h2>
<p>

Experience has shown that many readers will have been made
very uncomfortable, if not positively antagonistic, by my
remarks about the role of computing and computer programs
in philosophy and the scientific study of human possibilities.
There are several reasons for this, including (a) ignorance of
the nature of computers and computer programs, (b)
misunderstandings about the way computers are used in this sort
of enterprise, (c) invalid inferences from the premises that
computer simulations of human minds are possible, and (d)
confused objections to specific theories expressed as
computer simulations.
<a name="5.1."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
5.1. What is a computer?
</I>
</b></h3>
It is not helpful to think of a computer simply as something
which does numerical calculations, for this is only one use of
a far more general facility. A computer is a mechanism which
interacts with symbols. It can accept symbols, store them,
modify them, examine them, compare them, construct them,
interpret them, obey them (if they express instructions), or
transmit them. It must therefore include a 'store' or 'memory'
containing a large number of locations at which symbols can
be stored. These locations must be 'addressable': that is, it
should be possible for an instruction somehow to mention a
location so that its contents can be examined or something
new put there. The mechanism may assume that all the basic
symbols stored used some fixed format, such as sequences of
zeros and ones, but that is no restriction, as sufficiently
complex combinations of such symbols can be used to represent
anything, just as complex sequences of the simple characters
on a typewriter can express poems, plays, propaganda or
physical theories, or complex arrays of dots can be seen as
photographs of faces.
<p>
Since the symbols stored in the computer may include
instructions for it to obey, and since it can be instructed to
change some or all of the symbols within it, it follows that as
a computer executes instructions within itself, the
instructions may change and thus the processes occurring may evolve
in complex ways. In the end, the original program may have
completely disappeared. Exactly how this happens may
depend not only on the original program but also on the
history of interactions with the environment. So no programmer,
or anybody else, is responsible for the eventual state of such a
mechanism  or for its behaviour.
<p>
In any modern digital computer the basic symbolic
processes which occur will all be very simple, such as putting a
zero or a 1 in some location, or comparing two symbol-strings,
or copying the contents of one location into another, or
performing logical or arithmetical operations. But it is not
helpful to think of a computer as 'simply' performing such simple
operations, any more than it is helpful to think of a
Shakespeare play as 'simply' composed of letters, punctuation
marks, and spaces.
<p>
Computers can perform millions of their basic operations
each second. Many different kinds of books can be written
using the same small set of printed characters, and similarly
an enormous variety of processes can be represented by
complex combinations of the simple processes in a computer.
<p>
In particular, the processes need not be fully controlled by
all the symbols in the store at any time. For among the
instructions executed may be some to the effect that new
symbolic information should be accepted from various
devices attached to the computer, such as a television camera
or a microphone, or a teletype at which a person sits
communicating with the computer. Some of the new symbols
coming into the computer in this way may lead to changes in
the stored instructions, just as much as execution of stored
instructions can. (This, incidentally, is why all the
philosophical debates about Godel's incompleteness theorem and related
theorems proving that there are limits to what any particular
computing system can do, are irrelevant to the problem of
what sorts of intelligent mechanisms can be designed: for all
these theorems are relevant only to 'closed' systems, i.e.
systems without means of communicating with teachers, etc.)
<p>
Computing science is still in a very early phase. Only a tiny
fragment of the possible range of computer programs has so
far been investigated, and many of these are still only partly
understood. Complex programs sometimes work for reasons
which their designers only half understand, and often they
fail in ways which their designers cannot understand. It
follows that nobody is in a position to make pronouncements
about the limits of what can be done by computer programs,
especially programs which interact with some complex
environment, as people do.
<p>
Attempting such pronouncements is about as silly as
attempting to use an analysis of the printing process to
delimit the kinds of theories that will be expounded in
text-books of physics in a hundred years time. Nevertheless,
people with theological or other motives for believing that
computers cannot match human beings will continue to be
overconfident about such matters (e.g. H. Dreyfus, <i>What Computers Can't Do).</i>
<p>
The last general remark I wish to make about computers is
that the definition given above does not assume anything
about what the mechanism is made of. It could be transistors,
it could be more old-fashioned electronic components, it
could be made of physical components not yet designed, it
could somehow be made out of some non-physical spiritual
stuff, if there is any such thing. The medium or material used
is immaterial! All that matters is that enough structures are
available to represent the required range of symbols, and that
appropriate structural changes can occur in the computer. As
Margaret Boden once remarked, angels jumping on and off
pin-heads would do.
<p>
This is not the place to enlarge further on what computers
are. Interested readers should consult <i>Electronic Computers,</i>
by Hollingdale and Toothill, or Weizenbaum's <i>Computer Power and Human Reason.</i> See also chapter 8
of this book.
<a name="5.2."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
5.2. A misunderstanding about the use of computers
</I>
</b></h3>
I have heard people talk as if computers were some new kind
of organism, distantly related to humans or other animals, so
that one might perhaps learn something about animals or
their brains by studying computers!
<p>
However, computers are not natural objects to be studied.
They are artefacts to be improved and used. If people had
been content to <i>study</i> computers instead <i>of programming</i>
them, very little would have been learnt, for a computer does
nothing unless it is programmed. But what it does depends on
how it is programmed. So approaching a computer with a
view to finding out what it can do is as silly as it would be for
a physicist to study pencil and paper with a view to finding
out what they can do. One approaches a computer in order
to try to make it do something. The physicist writes things
down, calculates, tries out formulae and diagrams, etc. He
constructs, explores and modifies a theory. That is how to
use a computer in order to study intelligence: by designing a
program which will make it behave intelligently one
constructs a theory, expressed in that program, about the
possibility of intelligence. The failure of the theory is your own
failure, not the computer's.
<p>
So objections to the discipline of artificial intelligence
based on the assumption that its practitioners <i>study</i>
computers are completely misguided.
<a name="5.3."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
5.3. Connections with materialist or physicalist theories of mind
</I>
</b></h3>
Many readers (some sympathetic and some unsympathetic)
will jump from the premiss that computer programs can
simulate aspects of mind, or can themselves be intelligent and
conscious, to the conclusion that some kind of materialist or
physicalist theory of mind is correct. Alternatively they will
assume that because I stress the importance of computing
studies, I support some kind of reductive materialist theory.
There are two answers to this.
<p>
The short answer is that just because an electronic
computer is a physical system, it does not follow that everything
it successfully simulates is a physical system: there could be
computer programs simulating the structures and functions
of mechanisms composed of some spiritual substance!
<p>
So even if the human mind is not merely a function of the
physical brain, but has some non-material or non-physical
basis (whatever that may mean), then the behaviour or
function of that stuff is what computer programs can simulate.
In fact a program does not specify what kind of computer it
runs on. The computer may use transistors, valves or spiritual
mechanisms, so long as a rich enough variety of structural
changes is available, as I have already pointed out.
<p>
A longer, and more important, answer is that the
<i>ontological</i> status of mind has little relevance to the
problems of
this book. Both Dualism, which postulates some kind of
spiritual entity distinct from physical bodies, and Materialism,
according to which minds are just aspects of complex physical
systems, lack explanatory power. That is, both of them fail
on the criteria proposed in chapter 2 for adequate
explanations in philosophy or science. They fail either to describe
or to explain any of the fine structure of such aspects of
mind as perception, memory, reasoning, understanding,
deciding, desiring, enjoying, creativity, etc., or the relations
between them.
<p>
In order to explain how all these things are possible, we
need a theory describing or representing the structures and
functions of a mechanism which can be shown to have the
right sorts of abilities, that is a mechanism able to generate
within itself structures and processes with the kinds of
mutual relationships which we know hold between mental
phenomena. For instance, we know that a certain experience,
such as seeing a tool being used, can produce a change in
what a person knows, and thereby can change what he is able
to do and the decisions he can take in order to deal
intelligently with problems. To explain how this sort of thing is
possible, e.g. to explain how one can learn to operate a tool
by watching its use, it will not do simply to say what kind of
<i>stuff</i> the underlying human mental mechanism is made of.
<p>
Being told that a computer is made of physical components,
for instance, tells you nothing about the kind of internal
organisation that made it possible for the PDP-1O computer
used by Winograd (1973) to hold conversations in
ordinary English. Similarly, being told that the mind is
spiritual or non-physical explains nothing.
<p>
For similar reasons, neurophysiology cannot help in the
early stages of the search for explanations of the possibility
of mental phenomena  and we shall remain in the early
stages for some time. Studies of neurophysiology, or the
electronic basis of a computer, may explain such things as how
fast the system performs, and why it sometimes goes more
slowly, or why it sometimes breaks down altogether; but
cannot at present explain how it is possible for the system to
perform a particular type of task at all. Such an explanation
requires study of the brain's <i>programs,</i> not its
low level (physical) <i>architecture</i>
and neurophysiology currently lacks conceptual and other
tools needed for studying programs. (Study of a computer's
architecture tells one practically nothing about the programs
currently running on it. The programs may change drastically
while the physical architecture remains the same, and different
computer architectures may support the same programs.
Computers are not like clocks.)
<p>
[Note added 2001: I would now put this by saying that the virtual
machine architecture is more important than the physical machine
architecture.
<br>
(For more on this see recent papers in
<br>
<a
href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/</a>).
<br>
The study of physical architectures would be relevant if it could be used to
demonstrate that certain sorts of virtual machines <i>could</i> and others could
<i>not</i> run on brains. But right now we still do not know enough about ways
of mapping virtual machines onto physical machines for useful constraints to be
derived.]
<p>
The only kinds of explanatory mechanisms that have some
hope of being relevant to explaining mental possibilities like
perception, learning and decision making, are mechanisms for
manipulating complex symbols, for example, computer
<i>programs.</i>
<p>
People whose sole experience of computing is with
programs for doing highly repetitive algorithmic numerical
calculations, or programs for simulating feedback systems, may
find it hard to understand how programs can be relevant to
our problems. An essential antidote to this prejudice is a
study of the literature of artificial intelligence to learn how,
besides doing numerical calculations in an order determined
by the programmer, computer programs can also construct,
analyse, interpret, manipulate, and use complex symbolic
structures, like lists, pictures, sentences or even sub-programs,
in a flexible way determined by analysis of developments
during the computation rather than following an order worked
out in advance by the programmer.
<p>
All this can be summarised by saying that the known
important mechanisms are not <i>computers</i> (those ugly boxes
with mysterious noises and flashing lights), but <i>programs</i>
or <i>virtual machines</i>.
Computers are an old type of mechanism: they are physical
machines. Programs are a new type. A simulation program
could drive not only a physical computer, but, if ever one
were made, a computer composed entirely of spiritual stuff
(The program, not the medium, is the message.)
<a name="5.4."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
5.4. On doing things the same way
</I>
</b></h3>
The persistent objector may now argue that the explanatory
power of computer programs is doubtful, since even if a
program does give a machine the ability to do something we can
do, like understand and talk English, or describe pictures, that
leaves open the question whether it does so <i>in the same
way</i> as we do; so it remains unclear whether the program gives a
correct explanation <i>of our</i> ability.
<p>
The objector may add that it is clear that existing computers do
<I>not</I> do things the way
we do, since, at the physical level they use transistors and bits
of wire, etc., whereas our brains do not, and even at the level
of programs they have to employ interpreters or compilers
which translate the high level intelligent and flexible
symbol-manipulating programs into sequences of very simple and
very mechanical instructions which have to be followed
blindly, whereas there is no evidence that humans do this.
<p>
This objection (which seems to pervade the book by H.L.
Dreyfus, <i>What Computers Can't Do),</i> is based on the
concept
'doing things in the same way', which requires some analysis.
<p>
The notion of doing something <i>in the same way</i> is
systematically ambiguous. Two persons may calculate the answer to
an arithmetical question in the same way insofar as they both
use logarithms but in different ways insofar as they use
logarithms with different bases. It is all a matter of how much and
what sort of detail of a process is described in answer to the
question In what way did he do it?' That some very detailed
description would be different in the case of a computer does
not imply that there is no important level at which it does
something the same way as we do. We don't say a Chinaman
plays chess in a different way from an Englishman, <i>simply</i>
because he learns and applies the rules using a different
language, so that his thinking goes through different symbolic
processes. He may nevertheless use the same strategies.
<p>
The same problem arises about whether two computer
programs producing equivalent results do so in the same way.
Two programs using essentially the same algorithm may look
very different, because they are written in different languages
or in different programming styles. Any program is a mixture
of 'main ideas' and implementation details. The same may be
true of human abilities.
<p>
The problem of knowing the way in which a computer
does something is no different in principle from the problem
of knowing the way in which a person does it. In both cases
there are questions that can be asked, and tests that can be
given, which provide useful clues. (Compare Wertheimer's
tests for whether children understand and apply a technique
for finding areas of a parallelogram in the same way as he
does, in <i>Productive Thinking,</i> chapter I. He sees whether they
can solve a very varied range of problems.)
<p>
Insofar as anything clear and precise can be said about 'the
way' in which a human being does something (e.g. plays chess,
interprets a poem, or solves a problem) the appropriate
procedure can in principle be built into a suitable simulation, so
that we <i>ensure</i> that the machine does it in the same way. For
instance, programs can be written to do multiplications using
ordinary decimal arithmetic, or binary arithmetic, or
alternatively using natural language.
<p>
Finally it should be noted that it is very unlikely that there
is only <i>one</i> way in which something or other is done by <i>all</i>
human beings, whether it be perceiving faces, remembering
names, playing chess, solving problems, or understanding a
particular bit of English: we all have our own quirks and
foibles, so it-is unreasonable to deny this right to a complex
computer simulation.
<p>
I do not wish to argue that <i>every</i> aspect of the human
mind can be simulated on digital electronic computers, any
more than an astronomer's explanation of an eclipse explains
or predicts every aspect of the motion of the earth, moon
and sun. For instance, certain types of human experience
seem to be possible only for beings with human bodies, or
bodies with very similar structures. Thus, feeling thirst,
nausea, muscular exhaustion, sexual desire, the urge to dance
while listening to music, or the complex combination or
bodily sensations when one is about to lose one's balance
whilst walking on ice, may be forever inaccessible to
computer programs within immobile rectangular boxes, or even
to humanoid mobile robots who are made mainly of plastic
and metal. (For more on these general issues, see the
contributions by H.L. Dreyfus, N.S. Sutherland, and myself to
<i>Philosophy of Psychology,</i> ed. S.C. Brown.)
<p>
These abstract debates about what can and cannot be done
with computer programs are not too important. Usually there
is more prejudice and rhetoric than analysis or argument
on both sides. What is important is to get on with the job of
specifying what sorts of things are possible for human minds,
and trying to construct, test, and improve explanations of
those possibilities. Anyone who objects to a particular
explanation expressed in the form of a program, should try to
construct another better explanation of the same range of
possibilities, that is, better according to the criteria by which
explanations are assessed (see chapter 2). The preferred
explanation should account for at least the same range of
possibilities with at least as much fine structure.
<p>
The rest of this book will be concerned mainly with the
description of some important possibilities known to
common sense, together with some rather sketchy accounts of
what good explanations might look like. I shall frequently
point out ways in which the attempt to design computer
simulations can subserve the endeavour to understand the
human mind.

After this book was published there was a revival of
interest among many AI researchers in "connectionist" architectures.
Some went so far as to claim that previous approaches to AI had failed,
and that connectionism was the only hope for AI. Since then there have
been other swings of fashion. It should be clear to people whose primary
objective is to understand the problems rather than to win media debates
or do well in competitions for funding that there is much that we do not
understand about what sorts of architectures are possible and what their
scope and limitations are. It seems very likely that very different
sorts of mechanisms need to be combined in order to achieve the full
range of human capabilities, including controlling digestion,
maintaining balance while walking, recognising faces, gossiping at the
garden gate, composing poems and symphonies, solving differential
equations, and developing computer programs such as operating systems
and compilers.
I don't know of an any example of an AI system, whether implemented
using neural nets, logical mechanisms, dynamical systems, evolutionary
mechanisms, or anything else, that is capable of most of the things
humans can do including those items listed above. This does not mean
it is impossible. It only means that AI researchers need some humility
when they propose mechanisms.

<br>
A number of arguments against computational theories of mind have been
advanced since this book was written. Many of them use arguments that
were already rebutted in this chapter, or put forward views that were
expressed in this chapter. For example, the argument that brains work in
different ways from computers therefore computational theories of mind
must be incorrect is rebutted above by pointing out that systems may be
different at one level of description and the same at a more abstract
level of description. Abstraction is often very useful, as demonstrated
by the history of science in general and physics in particular. The
argument that intelligence or mentality requires embodiment is rebutted
by pointing out that some aspects of mind may depend on details of the
body whilst others do not. Of course, that leaves unanswered the
important research question: which forms of embodiment can support which
forms of mentality?
<p>
Many critics of AI and some defenders of AI have based their argument on
the assumption that AI in some sense presupposes that all computation is
Turing Machine computation. I have tried to argue in recent years that
the notion of "computation" is not sufficiently well defined to support
such criticisms. In particular I have argued that the notion of
"computation" employed by most users of computers, designers of
computers, programmers, and AI researchers, has nothing to do with
Turing machines but is an extension of two notions which go back to long
before Turing, namely
<ol type = "a">
<li>The notion of a machine that can control something, possibly itself
<li>The notion of a machine that operates on abstract entities, such as
numbers, or census information.
</ol>
Both ideas were well advanced before the beginning of the twentieth
century, for instance in automated looms, mechanical calculators and
Hollerith machines for sorting and collating information.
In the middle of that century advances in science and technology made it
possible to combine those ideas in new ways, providing far greater
speed, power, flexibility (e.g. self programming), and cheapness. These
points are elaborated in a paper on the irrelevance of Turing machines to AI

Sloman(2002)</a>, and other papers available here:

<p>
Despite all the progress of the last half century, it is clear that we
still have much to learn about the nature of information and varieties
of machines, including virtual machines, that can process information --

SKETCH OF AN INTELLIGENT MECHANISM<a href="#note6.1" name="ref-6.1">[Note

<p>
<a name="6.1."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.1. Introduction
</I>
</b></h3>
Much of this book is concerned with describing aspects of the
human mind. In the present chapter, I shall try to provide an
overall theoretical framework by describing very briefly and
crudely a type of mechanism which could be represented on
a computing system and which would simulate some of the
important general features of the human mind mentioned in
other chapters. Such a computer model would provide at
least a tentative and partial explanation of certain forms
of human possibilities, including the possibility of
accidental discoveries, and creative redeployment of old
resources.
<p>
In particular, I want to undermine a common
misconception about computers, namely that however complex the
programs that run in them they are always essentially
unintelligent, uncreative mechanisms, blindly following simple rules
one at a time. Such a description may well be true of the
underlying electronic components, just as it may well be true
to say that a human brain is always essentially an unintelligent
uncreative bundle of nerve-cells (or an assemblage of atoms)
blindly reacting to one another in accordance with chemical
and physical laws of nature. But just as the latter description
may omit some important features of what a brain can do, so
also the former description omits important 'high-level'
features of complex computer programs. What is true of a
computer need not be true of a program, just as what is true
of a brain need not be true of a mind. In both cases the whole
is far more than the sum of its parts.
<p>
I am not trying to explain phenomena which are unusual,
hard to observe, and known only to experimental
psychologists. The facts about people that I take for granted and
attempt to account for are facts which we all know, though
we may not all reflect on them, they are part of our shared
common-sense.
<p>
<a name="6.2."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.2. The need for flexibility and creativity
</I>
</b></h3>
In particular, I shall try to sketch the overall architecture of a
computing system which could cope with a variety of domains
of knowledge in a flexible and creative way, so that, like
people, it can use available information, skills and procedures
in order to solve new problems, or take decisions in new
situations, in ways which were not explicitly foreseen or planned
for by the programmer. The architecture to be described is
not physical but computational. It concerns global organisation, rather
than detailed mechanisms, and the sub-mechanisms are virtual machines
rather than physical machines. (Though they are all implemented in
physical machines, e.g. brains.)
<p>
Many notable examples of creativity are discussed in A.
Koestler's <i>The Act of Creation.</i> However, we can
also observe
frequent examples of what seems to be essentially the same
kind of flexibility and creativity in the daily life of ordinary
persons, in our efforts to cope with spilt milk, ungrammatical
sentences, unfamiliar typewriters, blind alleys, broken
suspenders, lost keys, illegible handwriting, mixed metaphors,
puzzle pictures and veiled insults. The child who uses his old
counting ability as a basis for answering new questions (like
'what number comes before five?') is as creative as any artist
or scientist. How can we explain this flexibility and creativity?
<p>
What is required is a design for a computing system which
is able to cope with types of possibility not covered by the
programmer's analysis. More precisely, it is necessary to
combine into a single system, competence in a variety of domains,
in such a way that expertise in two or more domains can be
combined creatively and flexibly in dealing with novel
situations or problems. Instead of the programmer doing the
analysis of all types of possibility in advance, the program
should be able, in at least some cases, to do the analysis when
it is appropriate to do so, and to record the results for future use.
<p>
<a name="6.3."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.3. The role of conceptual analysis
</I>
</b></h3>
Some insight into the mechanisms underlying human
flexibility can be found in a philosophical analysis of such familiar
concepts as <i>notice, alert, interested, puzzled, surprised, understand, cautious, attend, careless, reckless,</i>
<i>discern, try, recognize that,</i> and many
more. This analysis shows that to explain,
by means of a computer simulation, how it is possible for
available resources to be deployed in an intelligent and
creative way, we need at least to construct a system which
can act on the basis of multiple purposes or motives. Moreover, in the
course of executing some action it must be
able:
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>To notice something it was not explicitly looking for
<p><li>To interrupt, abandon, modify or suspend some or all of
the current action,
<p><li>To search through its stock of resources for items which
satisfy a current requirement or need, possibly in an
unforeseen way (see (a)),
<p><li>To relate parts and effects of one action to purposes
preferences or other motives
<i>besides those which generated the action</i>,
or more generally, to relate
facts to problems and purposes not currently being attended to.
</ol>
<p>
These abilities to make use of serendipity require the system to contain
mechanisms which facilitate communication of information between different
sub-processes in an unplanned way: the programmer need not have anticipated each
possibility inherent in the system. I shall now give a sketchy description of
how this might be achieved. Several steps in the construction of such a system
have already been taken by people designing artificial intelligence programs
(e.g. Sussman, 1975).

<h3><b>
<I>
6.4. Components of an intelligent system
</I>
</b></h3>
I shall describe (at a very high level of abstraction)
some of the <i>structures</i> the system will have to
contain; some of the <i>procedures</i> (or programs) that will be
needed to inspect, construct, manipulate, and use those
structures, and some of the <i>processes</i> that will be generated
when
those procedures are executed. The structures and processes
may be either inside the mechanism or in the environment.
<p>
However, it will be seen to be useful to blur the distinction
between the mind of the mechanism and the environment.
(This blurring in one form or another has a long philosophical
history. See, for example, Popper's <i>'Epistemology without a knowing subject',</i> reprinted in his <i>Objective Knowledge.</i> As
he points out, Plato, Hegel and Frege had similar ideas.)
<p>
We shall discuss interactions between the following
structures:
<ol type="1">
<li>an environment,
<li>a store of factual beliefs and knowledge,
<li>a store of resources (for instance a dictionary and
previously learnt procedures for making things, solving
problems, etc.),
<li>a catalogue of resources,
<li>a motivational store,
<li>a process-purpose index (action-motive index),
<li>various temporary structures associated with ongoing
information processing.
</ol>
<p>
Many more or less temporary internal and external processes
(actions) will be generated by these structures. There will also
be the following more permanent processes ensuring that the
actions which occur are relevant to the current motives and
that intelligent use is made of previous knowledge and new
information:
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>central administrative processes, not to be confused
with an homunculus (see also p. 244, Chapter 10, below);
<li>a set of monitoring processes, including both permanent
general-purpose monitors and others which are more
specialised and are set up temporarily in accordance
with current needs;
<li>a retrospective analysis process, reviewing current beliefs,
procedures and plans on the basis of records of previous
occurrences.
</ol>
<p>
The system must have several kinds of processes running
simultaneously, so that implementing it on a computer will
require multi-processing time-sharing facilities  already
available on many computers, and used in the POPEYE vision
program described later in chapter 9. This
<I>
global
</I>
parallelism is an important requirement for our mechanisms, though
concurrent processes can be implemented in a very fast serial machine.
<p>
<a name="6.5."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.5. Computational mechanisms need not be hierarchic
</I>
</b></h3>
<p>
The main parts of the mechanism will be described separately
in terms of their functions. However, computing models,
unlike previous kinds of mechanisms, should not be thought of
as composed of several interlocking parts which could exist
separately, like parts of an engine or human body. Normal
concepts of part and whole do not apply to computing
structures and programs.
<p>
For instance, two data-structures stored in the memory of
a computer, containing pointers to their elements, may
contain pointers to each other, so that each is an element of the
other. This can be illustrated by so-called 'list-structures'.
<p>
Thus, a list A may contain, among other things, the list B, while list B
contains the list A.
A is then an element of B and B an element of
A (which is not possible for physical collections).
A list may even be an element, or part, of itself. Examples
of circular structures will be found below in chapter 8. (For further
details consult a manual on some list-processing
programming language, e.g. Burstall, <i>et al.</i> 1973, or
Foster, 1967, or a manual on Lisp, Prolog, Scheme, or Pop-11).
<p>
Similarly, computer programs may be given names, in such
a way that at a certain point in the set of instructions defining
one program. A, there is an instruction of the form If
condition X is satisfied then run program B', while program B
contains a similar call of program A. Program A may even
contain an instruction to run itself. (These are examples of
'recursion'.) Such circular programs are able to work provided
certain conditions are satisfied which can be roughly summed
up by saying that during execution the series of nested, or
embedded, calls to programs (sub-routines) must eventually
produce a case where a particular program can run without
meeting the conditions which make it call another: it can
then do its job and feed the result back to the program which
called it, which can then get on with its job, and so on. This
is commonplace in programming languages which permit
recursion, such as ALGOL, ALGOL68, LISP, or POP-2.)
<p>
In such cases, we can say that program A is part of
program B, but B is also part of A. More complex chains or
networks of such circular relationships between programs are
possible. Similarly, human abilities, as we shall see, combine
to form complex systems in which normal hierarchic
part-whole relationships are violated: each of two abilities may be
a part of the other. For instance, the ability to read
someone's hand-writing may be a part of the ability to understand
his written sentences, and vice versa.
<p>
Because these ideas have been made precise and
implemented in the design of computing systems, we can now,
without being guilty of woolly and unpackable metaphors,
say things like: the environment is part of the mechanism (or
its mind), and the mechanism is <i>simultaneously</i> part of (i.e.
'in') the environment!
<p>
We turn now to a sketch of structures, programs and
processes in a mechanism to simulate purposiveness, flexibility
and creativity. I cannot give more than a bird's eye view of
the system at present. My description is deficient, in that it
does not provide a basis for a team of experienced
programmers to construct such a system. At best, it provides a
framework for further research.
<p>
<a name="6.6."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.6. The structures
</I>
</b></h3>
A structure is a complex whole with parts standing in various
kinds of relationships. The chapter on numbers (Chapter 8) gives several
examples. As parts are removed, replaced, or added, or
relationships between parts changed, processes occur within
the structure. In order that a structure be usable by the
system, there must be mechanisms (already to be found in many
computing systems) which are able to identify the parts, read
off or compute their relationships, match one structure against
another, interpret one structure as representing another, and
perhaps perform deductions in order to extract implicit
information about the contents of the structure. The system may
also be able to modify or 'update' the structure, by
modifying the components or their properties and relationships, or
adding new components. All the structures listed below will
be capable of changing, but some will be much more dynamic
than others.
Such manipulable structures are often referred to as
'data-structures'.
They function as complex symbols, or
representations.
<p>
The different structures about to be mentioned are listed
separately in terms of their different functions in the system.
But they need not exist separately. As already remarked, one
structure may be part of another which is part of it. Some of
the structures are in the mind (or computer), some not.
<a name="6.6.(a)"></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.6.(a) The environment
</I>
</b></h3>
This is a domain in which configurations can exist and
processes occur, some but not all of them produced by the
mechanism itself, and some, but not necessarily all of them,
perceivable by it. For instance, the environment will
normally be a space-time domain inhabited by the mechanism.
<p>
But for human beings it may also include, at the same time, a
more abstract culturally determined domain, such as a kinship
system, or a system of socio-economic relationships, within
which the individual has a location. Some of the 'innards' of
the mechanism or person may also be thought of as part of
the environment, since the system can examine and act on
them! (See chapter 10 for more on this.) Similarly, parts of
the environment, like internal structures, may be used as an
information store (blazing a trail, writing a diary, 'reading'
the weather-signs, putting up signposts), so that the
environment is part of the store of knowledge, that is, part of the
mind.
<a name="6.6.(b)"></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.6.(b) A store of factual information (beliefs and knowledge)
</I>
</b></h3>
This is a set of descriptions or representations of aspects of
the form and contents of the environment (including
descriptions of some of the system's own 'innards'). It may include
specifications of the current situation, previous history,
(especially records of the system's own actions and their
effects), and predictions or expectations about the future.
<p>
Several different kinds of language or symbolism may be used,
for instance sentences, networks representing sets of
relationships, maps, diagrams, and templates. Some of the information
may be procedural, for example, in the form of routes and
recipes. The information will necessarily be incomplete, and
may contain errors and inaccuracies. There may even be
undetected inconsistencies, and mistakes about the system's
<i>own</i> states and processes. We do not necessarily know our
own minds.
<p>
What gets into the store will depend not only on what
stimuli reach the sense organs, but also on what languages and
symbolisms are available for expressing information, and on
what kinds of perceptual analysis and recognition procedures
(i.e. the monitors mentioned below) are available and active.
(What is already in the store will also make a difference.
Where things are stored will depend on indexing procedures
used.)
<p>
In order that its contents be readily accessible, this store
of beliefs will have to have an index or catalogue associated
with it, possibly including general specifications of the <i>kinds</i>
of information so far available or unavailable. For instance, it
should be possible to tell that certain types of information
are not present without exhaustive searches. (How long does
it take you to decide whether you know what Hitler ate at
his last meal?) The index may be implicit in the organisation
of the store itself, like the bibliographies in books in a library,
and unlike a library catalogue which is kept separate from the
books. If books contained bibliographies which referred
directly to locations in the library (e.g. using some internationally
agreed system for shelf-numbers) the analogy would be even stronger.
<a name="6.6.(c)"></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.6.(c) A motivational store
</I>
</b></h3>
In a mind there will be at any time many current purposes
and sub-purposes, preference criteria, constraints on permissible
actions, plans for current and future actions,
specifications of situations to be avoided, etc. These likes,
dislikes,
preferences, principles, policies, desires, hopes, fears, tastes,
revulsions, goals, ambitions, ideals, plans and so on, have to
be accessible to the system as a basis for decision-making or
execution, so they will need to be formulated, in an
appropriate symbolism, in a motivational store.
<p>
If they are not
explicit, but are implicit in decision-making procedures, then
it will be much harder for the system to become aware of the
reasons for what it does, and to revise its decision-making
strategies. (Compare the discussion of consciousness in chapter
l0, below. A more detailed analysis would distinguish first-order
motivators, such as goals or desires, from second-order
motive-generators or motive comparators, e.g. attitudes, policies
and preferences.)
<p>
Some of the contents of the store will have been generated
on the basis of others, for instance as means, plans, or
strategies for achieving some end. (This store must not be thought
of as a 'goal-stack' with only the last added goal accessible at
any one time as in some over-simple computer
models.)
<p>
The representational devices may be varied: for instance some
<i>motivational</i> information might be stored in an apparently
<i>factual</i> form within the previously mentioned store of beliefs,
for example, in sentences like 'Jumping off objects is
dangerous', or 'Nasty people live in town T'. This can work only so
long as adequate procedures are available in at least some
contexts for finding and using this sort of information when
it is relevant to deciding what to do.
<p>
The processes produced by the mechanism, that is its
actions, whether internal or external, will be generated,
modified, controlled, interrupted, or terminated, by reference to
the contents of the motivational store, in ways to be
explained briefly below. Such purposive actions may include
planning processes, the construction of new motives,
problem-solving processes, external movements, manipulations of
objects in the environment, processes of modifying plans or
actions generated by other processes, and also perceptual or
monitoring processes.
<p>
One of the constraints on the design of a human-like intelligent system
is the need to act with speed in many situations. This has some profound
design implications.
In order that rapid decisions may be taken in a complex
world there will have to be a very large set of 'rules of thumb',
including rules for deciding which rule to use, and rules for
resolving conflicts. This is almost certainly incompatible with
assumptions made by economists and some moral
philosophers about how (rational) people take decisions. For
instance, there need not be any overall tendency for the rules
to optimize some abstraction called 'utility'.
<p>
At any time, some of the purposes or other motivational
factors may not yet have generated any process of planning
or action: for instance, a purpose may have been very recently
generated as a new sub-purpose of some other purpose, or it
may have a low priority, or there may not yet have been any
opportunity to do anything about it, or it may be a
conditional purpose (do X if Y occurs) whose condition has not
been realised, or some other purpose or principle (for
example, a moral principle) may override it.
<I>
Thus many existing motivational factors may generate no decisions.
</I>
<p>
Similarly, plans and decisions that have been formulated
on the basis of motives may still not have generated any
action for analogous reasons.
<p>
<a name="6.6.(d)"></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.6.(d) A store of resources for action
</I>
</b></h3>
This includes not only usable objects in the environment,
such as tools, materials, sources of information, teachers, and
so on, but also the store of factual beliefs, and, most
importantly, a set of readily available programs, or
procedure-specifications, some of which may use one another recursively
(as explained above in section 6.5, p. 116).
<p>
Among the resources should be linguistic or symbolic
abilities. Those are needed for formulating problems, purposes,
procedures and factual information.
<a href="#chap2">Chapter 2</a>
indicates some of the reasons why notational resources can be very
important. Chapter 7, below, explains why different kinds of symbolisms
may be required for different sorts of tasks or sub-tasks.
Other resources would
include procedures for constructing plans or routes (for
example, with the aid of maps), procedures for getting
information and solving problems, such as problems about why an
action went wrong, and procedures for constructing, testing
and modifying other procedures. (See Sussman 1975 for a
simple working example.)
<p>
That is to say, the resources store will include collections
of 'intelligent' programs of the sorts currently being produced
by workers in artificial intelligence. The concept of a resources
store, like the concept of an environment, expands to swallow
almost everything! This is why a catalogue is necessary.
<p>
<a name="6.6.(e)"></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.6.(e) A resources catalogue
</I>
</b></h3>
It is not enough for resources, like objects and abilities, to be
available. In order that they be intelligently usable, the
system must have information about them, such as what kinds
of purposes or functions they are typically useful for, the
conditions under which they are applicable, likely
side-effects, possible dangers, and any other information which
may be relevant to selecting a particular resource and
embedding it in a plan, perhaps with modifications to suit current
needs and conditions.
<p>
It must be possible for new information about typical
causes and effects, or requirements, of old resources to be
added to the catalogue. The system may have to use pointers
in the catalogue in two directions, namely, starting with some
purpose or need, it should be able to use the catalogue to get
at available resources which might meet that need. So pointers
are needed from purpose-specifications to resources. However
pointers are also needed the other way, since in selecting one
resource it may often be important to know what sorts of
uses, and effects, it can have besides the one which led to its
selection: if some other typical use of the resource matches
another current motive or need, then the resource may be 'a
stone that kills two birds'. Alternatively, if a resource selected
as a possible means to one end has a typical effect which will
frustrate some other current purpose (or principle, or
preference, etc.), then an alternative resource should be sought, or
the other purpose abandoned. Those are some of the design implications
that follow from the need to cope with multiple motives.
<p>
Sometimes information about typical uses and side effects
of a procedure (or other resource) can be got by inspecting
its <i>structure.</i> But often such things are learnt only by
experience of using the resource  and in the latter case we need
<i>explicit</i> additional entries.
<p>
For a very large store of resources, as in the human mind,
the catalogue will have to be highly structured, for instance
in the form of a tree, with lower levels giving more details
than higher levels. The organisation of the catalogue may be
partly implicit in the searching and matching procedures. As
indexing can never be perfect, the system will have typically
human failings, no matter how fast and large a computer is
available. (This is contrary to some optimistic
pronouncements about the way bigger and faster computing systems
will enable super intelligences to be made.)
<p>
This catalogue of resources, like the index to factual
beliefs, need not be physically separate from the store of
resources: it may be partly implicit in the organisation of the
store.

<h3><b>
<I>
6.6.(f) A process-purpose index (or action-motive index)
</I>
</b></h3>
The central administrative mechanism (described below) will
set various processes (internal and external actions) going, on
the basis of analysis of contents of the current motivational
base together with analysis of the resources catalogue and the
store of information about the environment. Some of the
processes will consist of sets of parallel or sequential
sub-processes, which in turn may have a complex inner structure.
Some of the processes may be lying dormant, waiting for
starting signals, or resumption signals from monitors (see
below). This is commonplace in computer operating systems.
<p>
In order to be able intelligently to modify ongoing
processes, terminate them, interrupt or suspend them, change
their order, and so on, in the light of new information, the
system will have to have information about which processes
and sub-processes are generated by any given motive, and
which motives lay behind the initiation of any one process.
<p>
The function of a process-purpose index is to store this
information about the reasons for various actions. It may
need to be modified whenever a new process is initiated or an
old one terminated, or when any of the reasons for doing
something change, for example, if one of the birds a stone
was intended to kill turns out to be already dead. The system
will thus have access to the reasons why it is doing things.
Faults in the procedures for keeping the process-purpose
index up to date may account for some pathological states.
<p>
So if a process generated by purpose PI accidentally
achieves a purpose P2, and this is detected by the monitors,
then the index shows which other processes were generated
by P2, and can therefore be terminated, unless the index still
contains a pointer from one of them to some other as yet
unfulfilled purpose P3. Other uses of the process-purpose
index will be mentioned below.
<p>
Perhaps one of the most important reasons why it is
necessary to be able to be in the midst of several different processes
at once, is that this provides opportunities to <i>learn</i> from
accidental interactions between processes, i.e. from serendipity.
The process-purpose
index, which relates current activities to the reasons for doing
them makes it easier to achieve such learning. For example,
one might learn that a certain purpose can be achieved in a
new way, because of an unexpected interaction between the
old strategy for achieving it, and some other activity.
<p>
The <i>process-purpose index</i> should not be confused with
the relatively more static, less changeable, <i>resources catalogue.</i>
Their functions are different. For instance, a particular
procedure may be selected, using the resources catalogue, in
order to achieve purpose PI, and then executed. While the
process of execution is going on, the same procedure may be
selected again in order to achieve another purpose P2. We
thus have two processes (actions) running in parallel in order
to achieve different purposes, yet the same procedure (or
program), a relatively permanent resource, controls them.
<p>
A clear example of this is a person playing two games of
chess simultaneously, and using the same strategy in the two
games for at least part of the time. If one of the opponents
makes a move requiring that strategy to be abandoned, the
process of executing it has to be terminated in one game but
<i>not</i> in the other.
<p>
The resources catalogue contains the relatively permanent
information (modifiable in the light of experience) that this
strategy is normally useful in such and such circumstances for
achieving certain types of advantage. The
process-purpose index, however, relates not the strategy itself,
but, for example, two current
<i>executions</i> or <i>uses</i> or <i>activations</i> of the strategy,
which
may
have reached different stages of advancement, to two current
purposes. Similarly the ability to multiply may be used twice
over in evaluating the following expression:
<p>
<CENTER>
(17-12) x (6+5)<br>
---------------<br>
(3 x 2)
</CENTER>
<p>
The process-purpose index would also have an important
place in planning activities, when instead of real executions
of strategies the index would contain pointers to
representations of possible executions of strategies.

<h3><b>
<I>
6.6.(g) Temporary structures for current processes
</I>
</b></h3>
At any time, various ongoing processes will have associated
with them structures containing information about partial
results, current values of variables, next instruction or
procedure step, current subgoals, where to send results, and so on.

<p>
Once the importance and ubiquity of such structures in a complex
goal-directed information processing system has been
understood, the distinction sometimes made between two kinds of
memory -- short-term and long-term -- evaporates, for
instance, in connection with a plan carried out over a period
of several years.

That point was very badly expressed, or just wrong. What I think I was

only two kinds, short-term and long-term memory, as some people appeared
to claim in those days, was a mistake.

<p>
The full details of these temporary structures need not be
globally accessible in the same way as some of the previous
a structures. That is to say, they are private to the particular
processes which use them. It may be, however, that certain
local computations, are automatically reported up to a global
level whenever they occur,
such as estimates of time or
computing space, or other resources needed  for
a process to be completed. This  might be  done  by  monitors,
described   below.
<p>
Some of the temporary workspace may be outside the
system, for instance a shopping list, an artist's rough sketches, an
engineer's calculations. Even a half-completed object is an
extension of short term memory for the constructor.

A similar point was made long ago by Herbert Simon in connection with insects
that produce the next step in a complex task by reacting to the current state of
the environment in which they are building something. This notion is often
referred to as 'stigmergy' and the phenomenon was known to entomologists in the
1950s. Good ideas are often re-discovered. This happened again some time after
this book was published: Simon's ideas were re-discovered and labelled "The
extended mind". Related ideas were promoted in the theory of "Situated

These more or less temporary structures are of no use to an intelligent
system unless mechanisms are available which can bring about the sorts
of processes already hinted at and elaborated below. Typical mechanisms
would be procedures for accessing, using, and modifying the resources,
catalogues, plans, etc. The whole system needs some kind of overall
control. This is the business of a central administrative process, for
which computer operating systems provide  a very first (very rough)
approximation.
<a name="6.6.(h)"></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.6.(h) A central administrator
</I>
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
<b>[[Paragraph added in 1986:</b>
<br>
To some extent, parts of the system may (and will) work autonomously in
parallel, e.g. posture control, control of breathing, and control of
saccadic eye movements. However, since two or more needs may require
incompatible actions, and since coordinating two actions rather than
performing them separately may improve overall performance, it may be
useful for some 'central' system to resolve conflicts and co-ordinate
decisions. A 'central administrative process' may have this role.
<b>]]</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
The central administrative process will at various times survey
the motivational base and purpose-process index and select from the
unfulfilled purposes a subset for generating further
planning and action. This selection may be driven partly by
previously selected purposes or principles, and may use
current information, such as estimates of likelihood of success or
failure, knowledge about opportunities and resources
available now and in the future, the current state of other actions,
and so on.
<p>
Sometimes no selection can be made until a change has
been made in <i>the set of purposes</i>  for instance by
inventing
a compromise between two conflicting purposes. In at least
some cases, the selection must be automatic to avoid an
infinite regress of decision making.
<p>
Similarly, after certain motives or purposes have been
selected for action, then in at least some cases they must
invoke suitable action-generating procedures automatically,
since if everything required prior deliberation or planning,
nothing could ever get started. This automatic activation can
happen when a current purpose closely matches a catalogued
specification of a typical use of an available procedure.
Monitors would be employed to reduce the risks inherent in some
automatic activation.
<p>
When no matching procedure is found for a certain
purpose P, in the resources catalogue, it may be possible instead
to find a match for the new purpose of <i>making a plan for achieving P.</i> For instance, if the purpose 'Go to Liverpool'
fails to match any current plan, then 'Make a plan for going
to Liverpool' may match a typical use (that is, making plans
for going places) of a procedure for constructing <i>routes</i> (for
example, find an atlas containing both your current position
and the destination, then . . . etc.). Again, even if one does
not yet know a procedure for making <i>objects</i> of a certain
type, one may have a <i>procedure for constructing a suitable procedure</i> for making those objects, by analysing
specifications of a required object and available tools and materials.
<p>
In short, when first-order matching fails, second-order
matching may succeed. Perhaps in some cases even
higher-order matching (make a plan for making a plan for achieving
P) may succeed.
<p>
Similarly, if several procedures are found to match the
purpose, then a new purpose may have to be set up, namely
the purpose of choosing between the available alternatives. If
a choice cannot be made using the information in the
resources catalogue, it may be necessary to try out some of the
alternatives. (See chapter 8 for more on the difference
between examining and executing procedures.) This kind of
comparison of alternatives may occur at various stages in the
construction of one plan, contrary to the games-theoretic
analysis of human decision-making which assumes that we
always choose between <i>complete</i> alternatives, without saying
anything about how we construct those alternatives.
<p>
When the administrator has failed to find or produce a plan for a certain
purpose, a second-order task may have to be added to the motivational base as a
new unachieved purpose (i.e. finding a plan), to be attended to later if
anything relevant crops up, in ways described below. (This can produce
accidental learning: learning from serendipity.) Alternatively, if the original
purpose was very urgent, or there is nothing else to do at the time, then trial
and error with back-tracking may be used.

Some of the above ideas later turned up in SOAR, a problem solving and

SOAR also did not include the point in the next paragraph about checking

<p>
Should a suitable procedure for achieving P be found or
constructed, in any of the above ways, then analysis of its
typical uses and effects (recorded in the resources catalogue),
or analysis of its structure, may show that it, or a modified
version, will enable more than one current purpose or motive
to be fulfilled. If several suitable alternatives are available,
this analysis may provide a reason for choosing between them.
Or it may show that the procedure would interfere with some
other current purpose. A process (action, procedure-execution)
is then generated by executing the selected procedure with
suitable arguments or parameters bound to its variables (for
example, 'destination' might be bound to 'Liverpool' in the
previous example).
<p>
The central administrator (and perhaps also some of the
other currently running programs) must be able to interrupt,
terminate, modify, or restart current processes (though some
may be less controllable than others, for instance if they are
so well-tried that possible interrupt points have been kept to
a minimum). These control decisions will be taken on the
basis of new information from <i>monitors</i> (described below),
using the purpose-process index as described above. So the
index must be changed every time a process is begun,
modified, halted, or found to be capable of serving an unexpected
purpose as a side effect, as well as when ongoing processes set
up new sub-goals and generate corresponding sub-processes.
<p>
Some processes which include complex sets of sub-processes,
may have to have their own private purpose-process indexes
in their private work spaces (see p. 124), as well as being more
briefly represented in the main index. They may also have
their own central administrators!
<p>
Chapter 10 attempts to relate the idea of central
decision-making processes to the distinction between what we are and
what we are not conscious of.
<a name="6.6.(i)"></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.6.(i) Perception and monitoring programs
</I>
</b></h3>
Mechanisms must be available for inspecting the environment
in which the system acts, such as familiar types of
sense-organ for inspecting the external environment, and less
familiar mechanisms for accessing structures within the system
(the internal environment). However, all that a <i>physical</i>
sense-organ can do is produce some kind of spatial or temporal
array or manifold of physical values (as a television camera or
microphone does). This does not yet amount to perception:
it simply amounts to the production of a new structure
within the system. Whether anything is thereby perceived,
and what is perceived, depends on what procedures (or
programs) are available for analysing the new structure, finding
relationships between its parts, perhaps manipulating or
modifying it (for example, correcting misprints or other
errors), interpreting it, and making use of all this either
immediately or later on in the performance of actions or
solving of problems.
<p>
Such perceptual procedures may involve computations of
arbitrary complexity, using a great deal of background
knowledge, like the perceptual procedures involved in a medical
diagnosis or the tuning of a car engine. Even ordinary
perception of simple shapes and familiar physical objects can be
shown to presuppose considerable factual and procedural
knowledge. This is why perception cannot be separated from
cognition. See chapter 9 for more details.
<p>
So the system needs a collection of perceptual procedures,
for analysing and interpreting various kinds of structures in
various kinds of contexts. The limits of these procedures
together with the limits of the sense-organs and the current
store of information about the environment will define what
the system is capable of perceiving. Systems with the same
physical sense organs may therefore have quite different
perceptual abilities  as we know from variations in human
perception. Thus there cannot be any such thing as perceiving
things 'directly' or 'as they are in themselves'. As Max Clowes
once put it: ''We inhabit our data-structures''. The same must be true
of intelligent machines. So the objective/subjective distinction
evaporates. (Compare Boden, 1977.)
<p>
The range of types of objects, properties and relationships
that human perceptual procedures are capable of coping with
is enormous. So in a sensible system they will not all be
applied to every possible chunk of sensory input or
meaningful structure. For instance, when you last read a page of
typescript you probably did not use your ability to notice that
the letters on the page were in vertical columns as well as
horizontal rows; and while listening to someone talking one
language you know, you do not apply the analysis procedures
which would enable you to recognise in his syllable-stream
the sounds of words of another language you know. Did you
notice the let' in letters' or 'horizon' in 'horizontal' above?
If every available analytical and interpretive procedure were
applied, their outputs would form an enormous information
store, and the system would then have the problem of
perceiving its contents in order to make use of the information.
<p>
It seems not only sensible, but also to correspond to
human experience, to have only a small selection of available
perceptual programs running at any time in relation to any
one piece of 'perceivable' structure, such as the structures
mentioned in the previous sections or those produced by
sense-organs. There are serious problems in explaining how
appropriate programs are selected.
<p>
The active analysis programs may be called
<i>'monitors'</i><a href="#note6.2" name="ref-6.2">[note 6.2]</a>
and
it seems to be necessary to have two main kinds of
monitoring  general purpose and special purpose. The former
involves frequent and large-scale application of relatively
simple analyses and tests which have a good chance of being
relevant to a wide range of purposes and circumstances. (Is
anyone calling out my name? Is something on my retina
moving?) The special purpose monitors may be more
complex, and will be set up only when there is a specific reason
to expect that they will find something or that if they find
something it will be very useful in relation to current motives.
<p>
In either case the monitor need not itself complete the
analysis and interpretation of new information. Instead, what
it finds may act as a <i>cue</i> (or reminder, or stimulus) which will
invoke (e.g. via a catalogue or index of resources) more
complex object-specific or problem-specific procedures.
<p>
For instance, if the environment is a spatial domain, then a
visual retina might be designed with very many relatively
simple general purpose monitoring procedures 'wired into the
hardware', for efficiency, instead of being expressed as
programs. So the retina might be divided into many small regions,
each being constantly monitored to see whether any change
has occurred in some physically detectable property
(brightness, colour, graininess of texture). If a change is noted, the
monitor sends an interrupt signal to inform processes which
may need the information. Other general purpose monitors
might be constantly monitoring these monitors to see
whether something which has consistently been reporting
changes stops doing so. There may be general purpose
monitors not only at the interface with the physical environment,
but also at several other interfaces. Perhaps every time one of
the globally accessible structures (such as the motivational
base or process-purpose index) is accessed or modified by any
current process, a general purpose monitor will note this and
send an appropriate signal or take appropriate action (such as
recording the fact for future reference). In recently developed
programming languages this is achieved by 'pattern-directed
procedure activations'. It is also a common feature of
computer operating systems, for example, to prevent
unauthorised access to information.
<p>
A very useful general purpose monitor would be one on
the lookout for 'I've been here before' situations: this might
enable loops, infinite regresses, and unnecessarily circuitous
procedures to be detected. However, the concept of 'the
same state as before' admits such varied instantiations that it
cannot be tested for in general by any one procedure. General
tests might therefore have to be restricted to a few
possibilities, like a return to the same geographical location, much
more specialised monitors being required if other kinds of
repetition are to be detected  another source of fallibility in
complex systems.
<p>
This will not work if records of previous states are not
retained. Alas, people do not remember everything, not even
their own actions. Repetitions often go undetected,
like recounting their exploits or telling you a joke
for the nth time. However, we shall see below that
remembering apparently useless things may be an essential
pre-requisite for certain kinds of intelligent behaviour and
learning.
<p>
A 'found something' signal from a general purpose monitor
may function simply as an <i>invitation</i> to some other program
or monitor to look more closely, applying special purpose
perceptual procedures to see if the occurrence is important to
current motives or processes. Depending on what else is going
on, the invitation may be ignored, or the new information
may simply be stored, without further analysis, in case it will
be useful later on. (Note that this presupposes some indexing
procedure.)
<p>
Special purpose monitors may be much more complex,
may have a much more transient existence, and may be set
up at all levels of complexity in the system. For instance, in
dealing with someone we know to be 'difficult' we need to be
on the look-out for danger-signals in their behaviour. And
while searching for a proof of some mathematical formula,
one may have good reason to suppose that if certain sorts of
intermediate results turn up in one's calculations they will
enable an easy proof to be found, whereas if others turn up
they will show that the formula was not provable after all. In
that case one could set up monitors to be constantly on the
lookout for the 'accidental' (or serendipitous) production of such results. (For
examples, see Wertheimer <i>Productive Thinking.)</i> The tests for
the occurrence of such special cases need not be at all trivial,
and it may be necessary to make inferences from obscure
cues, learnt in the course of considerable previous experience.
<p>
Watching out for multiplication or division by zero when
simplifying equations illustrates this: zero may be heavily
disguised in an expression like:
<CENTER>
a&sup2; + (a + b)(b - a) - b&sup2;
</CENTER>
<br>
So the monitoring required will have to be pretty
sophisticated. The same applies to detecting signs of irritation,
dismay, incomprehension, etc., in one's spouse or pupils.
<p>
Normally the 'something found' signal from a special
purpose monitor would be less likely to be ignored than signals
from general purpose monitors, partly because the latter will
always be crying 'wolf' and partly because the setting up of a
specialised monitor will reflect the importance of its results,
for current purposes.
<p>
Discoveries of the analytical and interpretative programs
constituting monitors may be added (perhaps after some
filtering by intermediate monitors) to the belief system (see section 6.6.(b)),
forming a record of events and discoveries. At this
stage a particularly important general purpose monitor should
be available to try matching each addition to the belief
system against currently unfulfilled purposes, or at least a 'high
priority' subset of current motives, to see whether the new
information satisfies or obstructs any of them. For example,
the newly discovered fact or technique may be a solution to
a problem you were thinking about yesterday. If it is a
<i>general</i> purpose monitor it will have to use <i>crude</i> matching
techniques, so some relevant relationships will be missed
unless specialised monitors are set up. (Again, we see how
fallibility is a necessary consequence of complexity.)
<p>
Not every piece of new information can be stored permanently.
The problems of indexing, shortage of space, searching for what is
relevant etc., would make this unworkable. But it may be possible
to store information for a short time in case it turns out to be
relevant to some process or purpose other than that which
generated it. This will be most useful in the case of 'raw' data
acquired for one purpose but potentially useful for others. If only the
<i>interpretation</i>
of such data is stored, then useful information may be lost. So
besides the interpretation made for one purpose it may be useful
also to store, at least temporarily, the original uninterpreted
information in case it turns out to be relevant to
other purposes.
It must
therefore be stored in a globally accessible structure.
<p>
In order to be really flexible and creative, the system will have to be
able to activate specialised monitors, from time to time, which ask the
following questions about new items of
<p>
information as they turn up:
<p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Does this imply that a particular current purpose has
been achieved or frustrated?
<p>
<li>Does it imply that particular current purposes are
unexpectedly near to or far from being achieved?
<p>
<li>Does it imply that a current purpose can be achieved
more efficiently or quickly or at less risk or cost, or
in a more enjoyable way, etc., by modifying an ongoing process
or terminating it and starting with a new strategy: that is, is there a
better way of doing what is currently being done?
what is currently being done?
<p>
<li>Does it imply that any current purposes are mutually
incompatible?
<p>
<li>Is this worth examining more closely to see if
questions like (i) to (iv) get a positive answer after
specialised investigation.
</ol>
<p>
<p>
Although such questions may occasionally be answered by
a simple match between a current purpose and new
information, at other times the full problem-solving power of the
system may be needed in order to detect the relevance of a
new fact, another example of the recursive, or non-hierarchic,
nature of computational systems. For instance, a stored
resource may not be found by a straightforward search in the
resources catalogue. However, some further analysis of what
is needed may solve the problem of where to search.
Alternatively, it may later be found to be related to a current
problem only when, by chance, it is turned up as a result of a
search generated by some <i>other</i> need, and a monitor, or the
central administrator, causes its relevance to the earlier
purpose to be investigated. The person who is looking for both
a screwdriver and eating utensils may be more likely to
recognise the knife on the table as a potential screwdriver than the
person who is simply looking for a screwdriver. But he must
also be able to relate the structure of the knife to the function
of a screwdriver.
<p>
<a name="6.6.(j)"></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.6.(j) Retrospective analysis programs
</I>
</b></h3>
For efficient and creative learning, the system will need to
analyse fairly lengthy and detailed records of events. Such
records will, as already pointed out, need to contain more
detailed information than is <i>obviously</i> relevant to current
needs, information retained in case it turns out to be useful.
<p>
For instance, examination of a series of failures over a long
period of time may suggest a generalisation about what
caused them, leading to a modification of some old
procedures. (Of course, some people never learn from their
failures, especially their failures in dealing with other people.
Why not?)
<p>
Similarly, if successes are sometimes achieved unexpectedly,
the system should go back and try to find out whether
enough information was previously available for the bonus to
have been predicted and planned for, in which case some
existing planning procedures will again need to be modified.
<p>
Records of events must also be searched for refutations of
previously accepted generalisations, and for new patterns
suggesting deeper explanations of previously known
phenomena. In some cases, retrospective analysis of difficulties in
getting at relevant stored resources may show the need for
reorganisation of the catalogue of resources or the index to
information. Thus, all sorts of comparisons need to be
constantly going on, relating new information, old information,
current motives, and possible future motives.
<p>
There is a tradeoff however: unbridled mechanisms supporting use of
opportunities for serendipitous learning can seriously drain resources.
<p>
Once again, retrospective analysis cannot be done simply
by a general purpose program, if it is to be at all deep. There
must be a preliminary general analysis of unsolved problems
to suggest that certain particular types of question need to
be investigated, and appropriate special purpose investigation
procedures invoked or constructed.
<p>
Normally many questions like 'Was my failure due to bad
luck or was there something wrong with the procedure by
which I worked out a strategy?' will remain unanswered.
Unanswered questions can be added to the store of unfulfilled
purposes, thereby enlarging the motivational base and
possibly influencing the course of events later on, if for instance,
one of these problems turns out accidentally to match some
information generated by another purpose.
<p>
Moreover, these unsolved problems may themselves
generate new processes of experimentation or exploration, for
instance in order to test some tentative hypothesis about the
scope of a regularity or the explanation of a surprise. Without
a major driving force provided by the need to answer
questions and solve problems, it is hard to see how human infants
could possibly learn as much as they do in the first years of
life. It is paradoxical that the words 'play' and 'toy' are often
used to denote this most important of all human activities
and its instruments. It is also worth noting that unless the
system in some way consciously or unconsciously distinguishes
errors in its own procedures from failures due to the
environment, it cannot modify its procedures and learn. Thus even
new-born infants and any organism that learns, must have a rudimentary
concept of 'self', contrary to popular opinion.

<h3><b>
<I>
6.7. Is such a system feasible?
</I>
</b></h3>
It will not be easy to construct a working computer model
containing these structures, procedures and processes. Many
problems have to be solved which are hardly even mentioned
in the ludicrously brief specification I have given. A suitable
type of environment must be chosen for the initial attempts,
with a rich but interconnected variety of possible structures
and processes. There are many difficulties in enabling so
many processes to interact. Existing computing systems used
in artificial intelligence are too small. Symbolisms will have
to be developed for expressing various sorts of purposes,
possibilities and plans, and for formulating entries in catalogues,
the purpose-process index and the belief system.
<p>
No simple and uniform notation can be expected to work
for all cases: sometimes a desired object may have to be
represented in terms of a function that it can fulfil, sometimes
in terms of a verbal description of its structure, sometimes
in terms of a procedure for constructing it, and
sometimes in terms of a template or model, similar in structure
to it. Usually a combination of representations will be
needed.
<p>
A language which is suitable for formulating a procedure
(or program) so that it can be executed efficiently need not
be equally good for constructing the procedure in the first
place nor for describing how that procedure works so that its
uses and limitations can be understood. The system may have
to use one language while a procedure is constructed and
debugged, after which it is translated (that is, compiled) into
some less accessible, less intelligible, less easily modified but
more efficiently executed form.
<p>
Programming such a system would be an enormous task,
yet it seems that existing expertise makes it all possible in
principle. For instance there are complex operating systems
which permit several different processes to run on a single
computer, as if in parallel (because small chunks of each are
run in turn), interacting with each other as they go, and this
would enable several monitoring programs and administrative
programs to run at the same time as programs for planning,
executing actions and retrospective analysis. The POPEYE
perception project, described in a later chapter, illustrates the
possibility of such parallelism, in a simple form.
<p>
<a name="6.8."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.8. The role of parallelism
</I>
</b></h3>
It may be necessary to have a computer with several different
processors, each containing its own time-sharing system, each
processor being devoted to some major function described
above, but all having access to the same set of stored
structures, but it is not obvious that this is necessary. It is often
supposed that the human brain has some tremendous
advantage over electronic computers because it operates in parallel,
but there is no reason to suppose that having very large
numbers of processors working in parallel would be an advantage
if they all had the opportunity of producing complex changes
in a central store: the mess might be impossible to control.
<p>
Parallel processors might be of use only for relatively simple,
general purpose monitoring of the kinds already described,
such as the monitoring of a retinal array for simple events,
and perhaps the monitoring of stored symbols for crude and
obvious matches with widely broadcast current requirements.
<p>
Since all this can in any case be simulated on a single, serial
processor, the distinction between serial and parallel physical
processors has not much theoretical significance for our
purposes. This is not to deny that parallel processing (which
can in principle occur on a serial processor) is crucial for the kinds
of interactions between processes described above.

<h3><b>
<I>
6.9. Representing human possibilities
</I>
</b></h3>
All this is part of an answer to the question: How should we
represent the human mind in such a way as to do justice to
the enormous variety of possibilities inherent in it? What a
person experiences, thinks and does over a period of time is a
single process with many sub-processes, but we know that if
he is a normal person then his mind contains, during that
time, the potential for many other processes which might
have occurred. (Compare
<a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/2088.ctl">Ryle, 1949,</a>
on dispositions). A computing system
of the sort just described could represent an explanation for
such human possibilities. Of course, the proposed system
could not account for all major human possibilities without
further complex mechanisms. For instance, nothing has been
said yet about how the possibility of moods and emotions is
to be explained. This would involve various kinds of
disturbances of the central processes. (For instance, feeling startled
is sometimes a result of rapid automatic re-organisation of a
collection of plans and actions in the light of a sudden
awareness of new danger.)
<p>
How wide a range of possibilities existed in such a system
at any time would depend on such things as how wide a range
of resources were stored in it, how complete the catalogues of
resources and beliefs were, and what kinds of matching
mechanisms were available. These, in turn, would depend, as in the
case of a human being, on how much and what kind of
previous learning had occurred. A mind contains a culture. So
anthropology must be part of psychology, and vice versa.
<p>
Nobody could hope to design a complete adult humanoid
robot. At best, it may be possible to produce a baby mind
with the ability to absorb a culture through years of
interaction with others.
<p>
<a name="6.10."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.10. A picture of the system
</I>
</b></h3>
It is possible to give a crude representation of some of the
range of possibilities inherent in such a computing system, or
a person, by means of a flow-chart. This consists of a set of
boxes (nodes in a graph) representing possible states or
sub-processes of the system, joined by arrows representing the
transitions that can occur between them.
<p>
If four arrows lead from box A to other boxes, this implies
that there are four possible states, or sub-processes, which
can occur after the one represented by A. Which one does
occur will, normally, depend on what sorts of things occur in
phase A, which in turn may depend on features of the
context, including a long history of previous processes. (The
normal approach in social science and much psychology is to shirk the
task of understanding such dependencies, by representing the
transitions as probabilistic, and studying the frequencies with
which they occur in a large sample examined superficially,
instead of studying particular transitions in depth.)
<p>
Each box represents a <i>state</i> of the whole system, so a
flowchart of this sort should not be confused with a chart in
which the boxes represent <i>mechanisms</i> of some kind and the
arrows indicate <i>flow</i> of something like energy or information.
Mechanisms are not states or phases, and flow between parts
is not the same thing as transition between states of the system.
A flow chart is not an architecture diagram (though it may imply
some architectural features.)
<p>
The chart summarising many examples of familiar kinds of
human behaviour, follows. (In the original book it was on
pages 138-9).
<p>

</b></h3>
</center>


<p>
This kind of flow-chart can be misleading in various ways.
<ol type="a">
<li>Each box represents a sub-process which may have very
great internal complexity, including many possible
alternative sub-processes.
<p><li>Because the chart has loops, the same box may be
entered twice, or many times  but each entry will
represent a different sub-process, and this is not represented
in the chart.
<p><li>The action of monitors is not represented. They
run concurrently with the processes depicted and can
detect unexpected events and cause interruptions and
jumps, for instance into box 8 or box 15.
<p><li>The chart does not indicate ways in which a path may
have to be re-traced. For instance, while executing some
plan one may reach box 5, then find that a required
object is missing, which leads, via boxes 14 and 11, back
to the top of the chart. The sub-process of box 11,
namely recording the reason why the object is wanted
and what is to be done with it when found (compare
what was said above about the process-purpose index),
ensures that when the object is later found or
constructed there is a jump back to where the system was in
the original process (box 5), so that it can continue,
unless an embedded entry in box 9, has led to a revision
of plans (and the process-purpose index) in the
meantime. Further, if the object cannot be found, it may be
necessary to go back to an even earlier phase, and
perhaps choose another plan for which the missing object is
not necessary. Thus, the possible jumps back to an
earlier phase are not represented explicitly on the flow
chart.<a href="#note6.3" name="ref-6.3">[note 6.3]</a>
</ol>
<p>
<a name="6.11."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.11. Executive and deliberative sub-processes
</I>
</b></h3>
It is perhaps worth noting the difference between the
clockwise loops (on the left) and the anticlockwise loops (on the
right). The former may be called <i>executive</i> loops, since they
represent the kinds of processes which can occur when there
is a plan of action and everything is going more or less
according to plan. The anticlockwise loops may be called
<i>deliberative</i>
loops, since they represent the kinds of things that can happen
when new planning is required, so that a question has to be
answered, or an unexpected new obstacle or resource has
turned up: the kinds of things which may require further
intelligent deliberation and decision-making, using the agent's
full resources.
<p>
The plans, or procedures, which generate uninterrupted
executive processes may themselves have been stored or
constructed only after previous processes of deliberation,
involving many circuits round the anticlockwise loops. Even when
things do not go wrong, there is always the <i>possibility</i> of
dealing with difficulties and surprises, represented by the arrows
going from left to right.
<p>
A system in which everything <i>always</i> worked exactly as
described above would be much more efficient and rational
than a human being. Nevertheless we know that human
beings are often <i>capable</i> of doing the kinds of things the
system can do, such as noticing unexpected obstacles and
changing plans. The system does not therefore explain what
people actually do; rather it generates, and thereby explains,
a framework of possibilities which, for various reasons, may
often not be actualised even though they would be
appropriate, as in failure to recall a well-known fact or name. For
reasons already mentioned, even a computing system of this
kind must be fallible when it is very large.
<p>
<a name="6.12."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.12. Psychopathology
</I>
</b></h3>
Notice that this outline of the structure of an intelligent
mechanism gives enormous scope for analysis of various kinds
of pathological conditions in which things go wrong. Indexes
and catalogues may be destroyed or corrupted. Plans,
procedures, and factual records may be destroyed or corrupted.
<p>
A spell in a peculiar environment may cause procedures and
beliefs to be constructed which interfere with efficient
functioning in other environments, and may be hard to erase or
modify. The mechanisms which manage the purpose-process
index may have faults. Monitors may fail to work normally,
or else their 'something-found' messages may not reach
appropriate destinations. A certain class of records may be
intact, but the procedures for interpreting the symbols used
may be faulty. Procedures for relating new information to
the index of current processes and their purposes may be
faulty. Good plans may be constructed, but mechanisms for
executing them may be faulty. Alternatively, execution of
available plans may proceed faultlessly, but the processes of
constructing new plans may fail for one reason or another.
<p>
Various sorts of learning catered for in the above scheme may
fail to occur. These are very general kinds of pathology.
Other more specific kinds would require a quite different
analysis.
<p>
Clearly, the task of interpreting and diagnosing
pathological behaviour in such a complex system must be extremely
difficult. It cannot be done without a good theory of the
normal structure and functions of the system. This is why I
have little faith in current methods of psychotherapy.
<p>
<a name="6.13."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
6.13. Conclusion: what is a mind?
</I>
</b></h3>
This ends my sketch of the main features of a mechanism able
to account for some of the main features of human thought
and action, that is, able to answer a large number of questions
of the form 'How is X possible?' In order to prove that such a
mechanism is possible, it is necessary to design one in much
more detail, filling in the form with much more content. The
attempt to do this will probably show up important kinds of
hidden circularity, incompleteness or inconsistency in my
description, leading to a revision of the specifications.
<p>
In order to demonstrate that this sort of mechanism
provides an adequate explanation of the possibilities available to
a human being, it is necessary either to analyse the
specifications of the mechanisms and of the possibilities to be
explained, and then prove mathematically that the mechanism
does generate the required range of possibilities and nothing
which it should not generate, <i>or else</i> to construct the
mechanism and run it experimentally in a wide variety of
circumstances to ensure that it produces an adequate variety of
behaviour, with the required fine structure.
<p>
The former is likely to be well beyond the possibilities of
mathematical analysis available in the foreseeable future, even
though the mathematical analysis of programs and proof of
their correctness is a developing discipline. In particular, it
assumes that we can produce complete specifications of the
possibilities to be explained, whereas one of the lessons of
artificial intelligence is that attempting to design a working
system often leads you to revise and extend your
specifications. The experimental method may require the
development of computers which have much faster processors and
larger memories than at present.
<p>
Whichever approach is taken, it is necessary to have a good
initial specification of the range of human abilities to be
explained, and this is best achieved by combining
philosophical techniques of conceptual analysis with the methods of
social science and psychology.
<p>
Since each of the abilities makes use of many others, like a
family of mutually recursive computer programs, there is no
logical order in which they should be described: no ability is
basic to the others. Further, none of them can be described
completely without describing many others. This makes the
task of constructing such descriptions, difficult, confusing
and very frustrating.
<p>
The abilities which the above system is required to explain
include:
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The ability to perceive and have perceptual experiences
<p><li>The ability to learn: skills, particular facts, general facts
<p><li>The ability to think about things  including things near
and remote, things previously met and new possibilities
<p><li>The ability to deliberate, decide, plan and act
<p><li>The ability to relate a purpose to available resources
<p><li>The ability to notice unsought-for facts
<p><li>The ability to reason, that is, the ability to use available
knowledge to extend one's knowledge
the ability to construct or manipulate symbols and
representations, both verbal and non verbal, for such
purposes as storing or communicating information,
reasoning, deliberating, guiding actions, and so on
</ol>
<p>
To specify these abilities in detail is to give at least part of
an answer to the question: what is a mind? or what is a
human mind? The partial answer is of the form:
<I>a mind is something which can do such and such sorts of things</I>.
To explain these abilities, that is, to explain how a single
integrated system can do all these things, is to explain how it is
possible for minds to exist. This does not merely make a
contribution to the scientific study of man. It also brings
many old philosophical discussions about the nature of mind
and its relation to the human body several steps forward.
(But it need not include anything that Aristotle would have
disagreed with.) In the process it is certain that many detailed
problems in different branches of philosophy will be solved,
rejected as confused, or brought nearer solution. The remaining
chapters of this book address a few of the more detailed
problems.

Flow-charts constitute a programming language. My remarks indicate
that the language is too limited in expressive power. I never use them in
my own programming, and do not teach students to use them, since
careful layout in a language like LISP or POP2 (augmented with good
iteration constructs) can achieve the same clarity without the same
limitations.

<b>[[Note added in 2001</b>:
<br>
Two themes that are implicit in this chapter turned
out to be important in later work, namely the role of real-time
constraints in a fast-moving world, and the potential for a mechanism
of the sort described here to get into an emotional state (See: A.Sloman
and M.Croucher 'Why Robots Will have Emotions' in IJCAI 1981,

along with other relevant papers at the

site.</a>)

<p>
The two themes are closely connected. The real-time constraints generate
a need for various kinds of interrupt mechanisms, alluded to in this
chapter. The potential for interrupts, which can disturb current
activity is intimately connected with emotional states (in at least one
of the many senses of 'emotional': some authors use the word so
loosely as to cover all affective states including motives and
attitudes.) These ideas were all developed further in the framework of the
<b>CogAff</b> (Cognition and Affect) project, which specified a "schema", the
CogAff schema, for a very wide range of designs of architectures, of which a
special case was the H-CogAff schema, including multiple concurrently active

individual development). For more information see the overview at CogAff web

<h3><b>
<I>
7.1. The problem
</I>
</b></h3>
Within philosophy, there has long been a conflict between
those who, like Immanuel Kant, claim that there are some
modes of reasoning, or inferring, which use 'intuition', '
insight', 'apprehension of relations between structures', etc.,
and those who argue that the only valid methods of inference
are logical, for instance the use of syllogisms and rules of
predicate calculus. This dispute is relevant to problems in
psychology, concerning non-verbal forms of thinking and
remembering (for example, the problem whether there is such
a thing as 'iconic' memory).
<p>
It is also relevant to problems about the nature of
mathematics and science. For instance, many mathematicians
adopt a logicist' position and argue that the only acceptable
mathematical proofs are those using the formalisms and
inference rules of symbolic logicians. They claim that where
diagrams, or intuitively grasped models are used, these are
merely of 'psychological' interest, since, although they shed
light on how people arrive at valid proofs, the <i>real</i> proofs do
not contain such things. According to this viewpoint, the
diagrams in Euclid's <i>Elements</i> were strictly irrelevant, and
would have been unnecessary had the proofs been properly
formulated. (For some counter-arguments, see Mueller, 1969.)
<p>
This issue is clearly relevant to teachers of mathematics and
science. Teachers who accept the logicist' position will be
inclined to discourage the use of diagrams, pictures, analogies,
etc., and to encourage the use of logical notations, and proofs
which are valid according to the rules of propositional and
predicate logic.
<p>
Kant's theories were opposed to this logicist position,
insofar as he argued that important kinds of mathematical
knowledge could be both <i>a priori</i> and <i>synthetic,</i>
that is,
non-empirical and non-analytic. I think he had an important
insight, though it has not been possible until recently to say
very clearly what it was. The issues can be clarified by
discussing different kinds of symbolisms, or representations, and
their roles in various kinds of reasoning. Some irrelevant
metaphysical digressions can be avoided by noting that such
reasoning can occur in computers, as well as in human minds.
<p>
One interpretation of what Kant was trying to say is that we
sometimes, for instance in mathematical thinking, use
non-verbal 'analogical' representations, and make inferences by
manipulating them, instead of always using logic. His claim is
that these non-logical (but not illogical) modes of thinking
may be valid sources of knowledge.
<p>
This topic is closely related to current problems in artificial
intelligence, for it turns out that different forms of
representation may differ greatly in their computational properties.
<p>
In particular, methods of representation and inference which
meet the approval of logicians will not necessarily be the best
ones to use in a computer program which is to behave
intelligently. Not all workers in A.I. would accept this. For example,

and <a href="#mccarthy-hayes">McCarthy and Hayes, (1969)</a>
argued that an intelligent
computer program will need to be able to prove by methods of
logic that a certain strategy will achieve its goal. They claimed
that this would be an essential part of the process of decision
making. I doubt whether they still hold the same views (see
Hayes, 1974), but the position they once advocated is worth
refuting even if they have changed their mind, since it is very
close to the views of many philosophers, especially
philosophers of science.
<p>
<a name="7.2."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
7.2. Fregean (applicative) vs analogical representations
</I>
</b></h3>
The main point I wish to make in this chapter is that there
are many different types of language, or representational
system, and many different ways of making inferences by
manipulating representations. The forms of inference codified
by logicians are relevant only to languages of the type
analysed by Gottlob Frege (see Bibliography), in which the
basic method of constructing complex symbols is by applying
function-signs to argument-signs. Much mathematical and
logical notation, and many  (though not all) of the constructions of
natural languages are Fregean. For instance, a first rough Fregean
analysis of 'Mary shot Tom's brother' would be something
like:
<blockquote>
<b>
Shot (Mary, the-brother-of (Tom))
</b>
</blockquote>
where the predicate 'shot' is treated as a two-place function
and 'the brother of as a one-place function. Pictures, maps,
diagrams, models, and many of the representations used in
computer programs are not Fregean. Some of them are
'analogical'.
<p>
This contrast between Fregean (or 'applicative') and
analogical representations will be more precisely defined later. It
is often referred to by people who do not know how to
characterise it properly. For instance, it is sometimes assumed
that analogical representations are continuous and the others
discrete, or that analogical representations are essentially
non-verbal (that is, that verbal languages do not use them), or that
analogical representations are isomorphic with what they
represent. These mistakes (which will be exposed later) also
go along with a tendency to assume that digital computers
cannot construct or use analogical representations. (See the
writings of Pylyshyn.)
<p>
Terminology is also often confused. What I have called
'Fregean' or 'applicative' representations are sometimes called
'symbolic', linguistic', 'formal', 'propositional', or 'verbal'.
<p>
The word 'symbolic' is unsatisfactory, since the ordinary use
of 'symbols', 'symbolism' and 'symbolic' is much more general
(for example maps can be said to be symbolic, even though
they are analogical). I shall use 'representation' and 'symbol'
and their derivatives more or less interchangeably as very
general terms, and will refer to any system of representation
or symbolism as a language, as in 'the language of maps'. I
shall use 'Fregean' and 'applicative' interchangeably.
<p>
One of the main aims of this chapter is to show that
inferences made by manipulating non-Fregean representations
may be perfectly valid. I believe this is at least part of what
Kant and Intuitionist mathematicians (for example Brouwer)
were trying to say.
<p>
Before developing the point in detail, I would like to stress
that I am not taking sides in the dispute among psychologists
who argue over whether people use 'iconic' forms of memory,
and reason with images. I believe that contributions from
both sides are often riddled with confusions, related to the
mistakes referred to above. It is especially important to
notice that the points I make about analogical representations
are quite neutral on the question whether such
representations occur in the mind or not. Even if they occur only on
paper (for example in maps and diagrams) the point is that
they can still be used in valid reasoning.
<p>
Useful discussion of these issues is impossible without
careful definitions of some of the main concepts, such as 'valid',
'inference', logic', 'verbal', 'analogical', 'Fregean' (or '
applicative'). However, before attempting to be more precise, I
shall present a few examples of reasoning with non-Fregean
symbolisms.

7.3. Examples of analogical representations and reasoning
</I>
</b></h3>
We can reason about set-theoretical relationships using Euler's
circles. Suppose we use a circle marked R to represent people
in a certain room, a circle marked S to represent students, and
a circle marked T to represent taxpayers. Then in figure 7.1,
the three diagrams (a), (b) and (c) all represent possible states
of affairs. Geometrical relations in the picture analogically
represent relations between sets of people. Whether any one
of them represents the way things are in the world is a
contingent matter, a matter of fact. It depends, in the case of (a)
and (c), on who is in the room at the time in question. This is
analogous to the way in which the truth-value of a sentence
depends on how things are in the world.

<p>

Figure 7.1 Euler circles

<p>
</b></h3>
</center>
<p>
Whether a picture correctly depicts the world is, in each
case, a contingent question  which can only be answered by
examining the world; but we can still discover, without
examining the world, that certain <i>combinations</i> of correctness
and
incorrectness are necessarily ruled out. For example, no
matter how things are in the world, we can use our
understanding of the methods of representation employed in such
diagrams to discover that it is impossible for (a) and (b)
correctly to represent how things are, while (c) does not, given
the stated interpretations of the diagrams. This has to do with
the impossibility of creating a diagram containing (a) and (b)
simultaneously, without the relation (c). <i>How</i> we discover
this is not obvious, but <i>that</i> we can is.
<p>
We are also able to use our understanding of the syntax
and semantics of English to tell that the following argument
is valid:
<blockquote>
All the people in the room are students.
<br>
No students are taxpayers.
<br>
<b>Therefore:</b> No people in the room are taxpayers.
</blockquote>
In both the verbal and the diagrammatic representation there
are problems about possible ambiguities of reference or
meaning. In both cases it is hard for people to explain why the
inferences are valid. Nevertheless, we can tell that they are,
and the study of such reasoning has occupied great logicians
since Aristotle, leading to many logical symbolisms designed
to capture the essential form of a variety of inferences.
<p>
It is worth remarking that when Euler's circles are used for
this kind of reasoning, the three diagrams of figure 7.1 are
normally superimposed in one diagram. This makes it harder to
perceive that a method of reasoning from 'premisses' to a
'conclusion' is involved. By contrast, in verbal arguments the
premisses and conclusion normally have to be formulated
separately. In some of the examples which follow, I shall
collapse the different representations involved into one
diagram or picture, in the usual way.
<p>

<a name="fig7.2"></a>
<h3><b>
Figure 7.2  Lever
<p>
<img src="fig7.2.gif" width="450" alt="[Lever]" align=center>
</b></h3>
</center>
Here are some more examples. In figure 7.2 the horizontal
straight line is to be interpreted as representing a rigid straight
rod, pivoted at the middle on a fixed support. In figure 7.3 each
circle represents a rigid wheel free to rotate about a fixed axle
passing through its centre, and contact between circles
represents contact <i>without slipping</i> between the wheels.

<p>
</b></h3>
</center>

<p>
In both
figure 7.2 and figure 7.3 the arrows represent direction of motion,
(of what? how can you tell?), so the figures represent
changing configurations. However, the arrows labelled (a) are to be
interpreted as assumptions, or premisses, and the arrows
labelled (b) are to be interpreted as conclusions, inferred from
the rest of the picture. In both cases, we can consider a bit of
the world depicted by the diagram and ask whether the arrow
(a) correctly represents what is happening, and whether
arrow (b)  correctly represents  what is happening.  In
each case, it is a contingent matter, so empirical investigation is,
required to find out whether the representation is correct.
(Just as empirical investigation may be used to check the truth of
premisses and conclusion in a logical argument.)
<p>
However, we can tell non-empirically that it is impossible
for arrow (b) to be an <i>incorrect</i> representation while arrow
(a) and the rest of the diagram represents the situation
correctly given the specified interpretations of the arrows, and
other features of the pictures. So we can say that the
inferences from (a), and the rest of the picture, to (b) is valid, in
both figure 7.2 and figure 7.3. Both examples could have been
replaced by two separate pictures, one containing only arrow
(a) and one containing arrow (b), as in figure 7.1.
<p>
Far more complex examples of inferences about
mechanical systems, using diagrams could be given. Figure 7.4 is
relatively simple. In figures 7.4 and 7.5, horizontal lines again
represent rigid levers pivoted at the points indicated by small
triangles. The circles represent pulleys free to rotate about
their centres, but not free to move up or down or sideways.
<p>
<a name="fig7.4"></a>
<center>
<h3><b>
Figure 7.4 Levers and Pulleys
<p>
<img src="fig7.4.gif" width="450" alt="[Pulley]" align=center>
</b></h3>
</center>

<p>
<p>
The vertical lines, apart from arrows, represent inelastic flexible
strings, and where two such lines meet a pulley on either side,
this represents a string going round the pulley. Where a vertical
line meets a horizontal line, this represents a string tied to a
lever. As before, the arrows represent motion of the objects
depicted by neighbouring picture elements. Once again, we
can see that what is represented by the arrow marked (b) can be validly
inferred from what is represented by the arrow marked (a) and the rest
of the picture.
<p>
Where the inference is more complicated, some people may
find it harder to discern the validity. In the case of logical or
verbal inferences, this difficulty is dealt with by presenting a
proof, in which the argument is broken down into a series of
smaller, easier arguments. Something similar can be done with
an argument using a diagram.

<p>
<a name="fig7.5"></a>

<h3><b>
Figure 7.5 Levers and Pulleys with added arrows.
<p>
<img src="fig7.5.gif" width="450" alt="[Pulley plus]" align=center>
</b></h3>
</center>

<p>
For example, figure 7.5 is just like figure 7.4, except for additional arrows.
The arrows marked (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) can be taken as representing
intermediate conclusions, where each can be validly inferred from the preceding
one, and (c) can be inferred from (a), and (b) from (g). Using the transitivity
of valid implication, we see that (b) is validly inferrable from (a). Notice
that it is not always immediately obvious what can and what cannot be validly
inferred. For instance, if the length of an arrow represents speed of motion, do
the inferences remain valid?
<p>
It is possible to give a computer program the ability to
reason about mechanics problems with the aid of such
diagrams. To do so would require us to formulate quite precise
specifications of the significant properties and relations in the
diagrams, and the rules for interpreting them, so that the
computer could use these rules to check the validity of the
inferences. Funt (1976) has done this in a program which
makes inferences about falling, sliding and rotating objects.
<p>
I have experimented with similar programs.
Making a program solve problems <i>intelligently</i> would
involve giving it procedures for searching for significant paths
through such diagrams, analogous to the path represented by
the arrows (c) to (g), indicating a chain of causal connections
relating (a) and (b). Finding relevant paths in complex
configurations would require a lot of expertise, of the sort people
build up only after a lot of experience. Giving a computer the
ability to acquire such expertise from experience would be a
major research project given the current state of artificial
intelligence. (At the time of writing a group at Edinburgh
University, directed by Alan Bundy, is attempting to give a
computer the ability to reason about simple mechanical
problems described in English.)
<p>
I believe that our concept of a causal connection is
intimately bound up with our ability to use analogical
representations of physical structures and processes. This point is
completely missed by those who accept David Hume's
analysis of the concept of 'cause', which is, roughly, that 'A
causes B' means 'A and B are instances of types of event such
that it has always been found that events of the first type are
followed by events of the second type'. His analysis explicitly
rejects the idea that it makes sense to talk of some kind of
'inner connection' between a cause and its effect. I suspect
that we talk of causes where we believe there is a
representation of the process which enables the effect to be inferred
from the cause using the relations in the representation. The
representation need not be anything like a verbal
generalisation. However, analysis of the concept 'cause' is not my
current task, so I shall not pursue this here.
<p>
So far my examples of valid reasoning with analogical
representations have all used diagrams. It does not matter
whether the diagrams are drawn on paper, or on a blackboard,
or merely imagined. Neither does it matter whether they are
drawn with great precision: detailed pictorial accuracy is not
necessary for the validity of examples like figure 7.4. It is also
worth noting that instead of looking at diagrams (real or
imagined), we can sometimes do this kind of reasoning while
looking at the physical mechanism itself: the mechanism can
function as a representation of itself, to be manipulated by
attaching real or imaginary arrows, or other labels, to its parts.
<p>
So by looking at a configuration of levers, ropes and pulleys,
and finding a suitable chain of potential influences in it, we
can draw conclusions about the direction of motion of one
part if another part is moved.
<p>
It is so easy for us to do this sort of thing, for example
when we 'see' how a window catch or other simple
mechanism works, that we fail to appreciate the great difficulty in
explaining exactly how we do it. It requires, among other
things, the ability to analyse parts of a complex configuration
in such a way as to reveal the 'potential for change' in the
configuration. We probably rely on the (unconscious)
manipulation of analogical representations, using only procedures
which implicitly represent our knowledge of the form of the
world. This point is closely bound up with the issues discussed
in the chapter on the aims of science, where science was
characterised as a study of possibilities and their explanations.

7.4. Reasoning about possibilities

</b></h3>
This ability to use the scenes we perceive as a representation
to be in some sense manipulated in making inferences about
possible actions and their effects, is central to our ability to
get around in the world. For instance, the ability to select a
path across a crowded room is analogous to the ability to use
a map to select a route from one place to another. Using the
map might be unnecessary if we could get a suitable view of
the terrain from a helicopter. We frequently use things as
representations of themselves!

<h3><b>
Figure 7.6  Map
<p>
<img src="fig7.6.gif" width="450" alt="[map]" align=center>
</b></h3>
</center>

<p>
Figure 7.6 gives a very simple illustration of the use of a map
to make a valid inference. It is instructive in that it also shows
a relationship between two representations of different sorts.
<p>
In (a) we have a map showing a few towns, marked by dots,
with the usual indication of compass points. In (b) we have,
not a map, but a representation of the direction (and perhaps
distance) between two towns. The arrow represents a vector.
Once again we can say that (b) may be validly inferred from
(a), though now we have to qualify this by saying that the
inference is valid only within certain limits of accuracy.
<p>
Many different uses of maps are possible. For instance,
from a map showing which crops are grown in different parts
of a country, and a map showing the altitude of different
parts of the country, we can 'infer' a map showing which
regions are both corn-producing and more than 100 feet
above sea level.
<p>
When planning the layout of a room it may be useful to
draw diagrams or to make flat movable cardboard cut-outs
representing the objects in the room, and to use them to
make inferences about the consequences of placing certain
objects in certain locations. This has much in common with
the use of maps.
<p>
This sort of example shows how a representation may be
used to reason about what sorts of things are possible. For
example, a particular arrangement of the bits of cardboard
can be used to show that a certain arrangement of the objects
in a room is possible. This is like the use of diagrams in
chemistry to show that starting from certain molecules (for
example H-H and H-H and O=O), it is possible to derive new
molecules by rearranging the parts (giving H-O-H and H-O-H).

7.5. Reasoning about arithmetic and non-geometrical relations
</I>
</b></h3>
Reasoning with analogical representations is not restricted to
geometrical or mechanical problems. Every child who learns
to do arithmetic finds it useful, at times, to answer a question
about addition or subtraction by using analogical
representations of sets of objects. For example, a child who works out
the sum of three and two by counting three fingers on one
hand, two fingers of the other, then counting all the fingers
previously counted, is reasoning with analogical
representations. The same thing can be done with dots, as in figure 7.7.
<p>
An important step in mastering arithmetic and its
applications is grasping that number names themselves can be used
in place of dots or fingers (that is, 'one two three' followed
by 'one two', matches 'one two three four five).

What is the largest possible number of persons who might

relation to you is your son's daughter's first-cousin? There
are various ways you might attempt to answer this sort of
question, but one of them involves drawing a fragment of a
'family tree', or possibly several family trees consistent with
the problem specification. A family tree diagram is an
analogical representation of a bit of the social world. Another
example of an analogical representation of a rather abstract
set of relationships is a chart indicating which procedures call
which others in a computer program. Flow charts give
analogical representations of possible processes which can occur
when procedures are executed. Both sorts of diagrams can be
used for making inferences about what will happen when a
program is executed, or when part of a program is altered. A
morse code signal is an analogical representation of a sequence
of letters.

7.6. Analogical representations in computer vision
</I>
</b></h3>
Some people working on computer vision programs have
found that it is convenient to use two-dimensional arrays of
numbers (representing brightness, for instance) as a
representation of a visual image. (See chapter 9 for a simple
example.)
<p>
Operations on the array, such as examining a set of points
which lie on a straight line', or possibly marking such a set of
points, make use of the fact that there is a structural
relationship between the array and the retinal image. Similarly, when
processing of such an image has produced evidence for a
collection of lines, forming a network, as in a line drawing of a
cube, then it is convenient to build up data-structures in the
computer which are linked together so as to form a network
of the same structure. A similar network, or possibly even the
same one, can then be used to represent the three-dimensional
configuration of visible edges of surfaces in the object
depicted by the line-image.
<p>
Manipulations of these networks (for example attaching
labels to nodes or arcs on the network, or growing new
networks to represent the 'invisible' part of the object depicted)
can be viewed as processes of inference-making and problem
solving, with the aid of analogical representations. It may be
that something similar happens when people make sense of
their visual experiences. (For more on this see the chapter on
perception and Clowes, 1971, Waltz, 1975, Winston, 1975,
Boden, 1977.)

<h3><b>
<i>
7.7. In the mind or on paper?
</i>
</b></h3>
It should be stressed that most of my examples are concerned
with diagrams and other representations which are on paper
or some other physical medium. The processes I am talking
about do not have to be completely mental, though mental
processes will always be involved if the representations are
interpreted and used for reasoning.
<p>
<b>Note added 24 Aug 2017</b>
(Compare the "Extended Mind" thesis mentioned
<a href="#extended-mind">above</a>.)
<p>
However, in some cases it
is possible for the process to be entirely mental, when we
merely <i>imagine</i> manipulating a diagram, instead of <i>actually</i>
manipulating one. Reasoning of this sort may be just as valid
as reasoning done with a real diagram. Unfortunately it is not
at all clear what exactly does go on when people do this sort
of thing, and introspective reports (for example It really is
just like seeing a picture') do not really provide a basis for
deciding exactly what sorts of representations are actually
used. (Pylyshyn, 1973.)
<p>
Although we are still very unclear about what goes on in
the minds of people, we can understand what goes on in the
mind of a computer when it is building arrays or networks of
symbols and manipulating them in solving some problem. By
exploring such programming techniques we may hope to get
a much better understanding of the sorts of theories which
could account for human imaginative exercises. Our main lack
at present is not data so much as ideas on how to build
suitable theories.
<p>
The illustrations in the preceding sections should give at
least a rough idea of what I mean by saying that sometimes
valid reasoning may be done by manipulating analogical
representations. Many more examples could be given. It is time
now to try to formulate more precise definitions of some of
the concepts used.
<p>
<a name="7.8."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
7.8. What is a valid inference?
</I>
</b></h3>
Consider first an inference expressed in sentences in some
natural or artificial language. There will be a set of premisses
PI, P2, ... Pn and a conclusion C, each of which is a sentence
(or is expressed in a sentence). In general, whether a
particular sentence says something true or something false, that is,
what its truth-value is, depends partly on its form and
meaning and partly on how things are in the world. So discovering
the truth-value requires the application of verification
procedures defined by the sentence and the semantics of the
language. So each of PI, P2... Pn and C may have its
truth-value determined by 'the world'. In spite of this it may be
possible to discover, without examining the world, that is,
without applying the usual verification procedures, that there
are constraints on the possible combinations of truth-values.
<p>
In other words, by <i>examining</i> verification procedures,
instead <i>of applying</i> them, we can discover that certain
combinations of truth-values of statements cannot occur, no
matter what the world is like. 'London is larger than
Liverpool' and 'Liverpool is larger than London' cannot both be
true: they are <i>contraries.</i> We can discover this by examining
the semantics of larger than'. (How is this possible?)
<p>
There are many other relationships of truth-values which
can be discovered by this kind of non-empirical investigation.
For instance, two statements may be incapable of both being
false, in which case they are called subcontraries by logicians.
<p>
Validity of an inference is a special case of this. Namely,
the inference from PI, P2... Pn to the conclusion C is valid
if and only if relationships between the statements constrain
their truth-values so that it is impossible for all the premisses
to be true and the conclusion false. So validity of an inference
is simply a special case of the general concept of a constraint
on possible sets of truth-values, namely the case where the
combination
<blockquote>
(T, T, ... T: F)
</blockquote>
cannot occur. So validity is a semantic notion, concerning
meaning, reference, and truth or falsity, not a syntactic
notion, as is sometimes supposed by logicians. They are led
to this mistake by the fact that it is possible to devise
syntactic tests for validity of some inferences, and indeed the
search for good syntactic criteria for validity has been going
on at least since the time of Aristotle,
<p>
It is an important fact about many, or perhaps all, natural
languages, that syntactic criteria for some cases of validity
can be found.
For, by learning to use such criteria, we can avoid more
elaborate investigations of the semantics of the statements
involved in an inference, when we need to decide whether the
inference is valid. The syntactic tests give us short-cuts, but
have to be used with caution in connection with natural
languages. It is not always noticed that our ability to discern
the correctness of these tests depends on a prior grasp of the
semantics of key words, like 'all', 'not', 'some', 'if and others,
and also a grasp of the semantic role of syntactic
constructions using these words. It is still an open question how
ordinary people, who have not learnt logic, do grasp the meanings
of these words, and how they use their understanding in
assessing validity of inferences. (For further discussion see
my 'Explaining logical necessity'.)
<p>
<a name="7.9."></a>
<h3><b>
7.9. Generalising the concept of validity
</b></h3>
Validity of inferences has been shown to be a special case of
the semantic concept of a constraint on possible truth-values
of a set of statements, which in turn is a special case of the
general concept of a constraint on possible 'denotations' of a
set of representations. This provides a basis for giving a
general definition of validity.
<p>
We have seen from some of the examples of the use of
analogical representations, for example, figure 7.1 and figure 7.2,
that the question whether a particular picture, diagram or
other representation correctly represents or 'denotes' a bit of
the world is in general an empirical question, which involves
using the appropriate interpretation rules to relate the
representation and the bit of the world. (Similarly, the truth of
what a sentence says is, in general, an empirical question.) We
have also seen that it is sometimes possible to discover
non-empirically, that is, without examining the world, that if one
diagram represents a situation correctly then another must do
so too. So we can easily generalise our definition of 'valid'
thus:
<p>
<blockquote>
The inference from representations
<b>
R1, R2, . . . Rn
</b>
to the
representation <b>Rc</b> is <i>valid,</i> given a specified set of
interpretation rules for those representations, if it is impossible
for
<b>
R1, R2 . . . Rn
</b>
all to be interpreted as representing an
object or situation correctly (i.e. according to the rules)
without <b>Rc</b> also representing
it correctly.
<p>
In this case we can say that <b>Rc</b> is jointly
<i>entailed</i> by the other representations.
</blockquote>
<p>
This definition copes straightforwardly with cases like
figure 7.1, where there are separate representations for
premisses and conclusion. The other examples need to be dealt
with in the obvious way by treating the single diagram as if it
were a compound of two or more diagrams. For example, in
figure 7.2 we can say that there is a 'premiss' which is the
diagram with arrow (a) but not arrow (b), and a 'conclusion'
which is the diagram with arrow (b) but not arrow (a).
<p>
Someone who actually <i>uses</i> a picture or diagram to reason with
may modify it in the course of his reasoning, and in that case
there are really several different diagrams, corresponding to
the different stages in the reasoning process.
<p>
Explicitly formulating the semantic rules which justify the
inference from a set of 'premiss' representations to a '
conclusion' representation, is generally quite hard. We do not
normally know what rules we are using to interpret the
representations we employ. Many workers in artificial intelligence
have found this when attempting to write programs to analyse
and interpret pictures or drawings. But the same is also true
of the semantic rules of natural languages: it is hard to
articulate the rules and still harder to articulate their role in
justifying certain forms of inference.
<p>
In the case of artificial languages invented by logicians and
mathematicians, it is possible to formulate the semantic rules,
and to use them to prove the validity of some inferences
expressible in the languages. In propositional logic, symbols
for conjunction '&amp;', disjunction V', and negation '~' are often
defined in terms of 'truth-tables', and by using a truth-table
analysis one can demonstrate the validity of inferences using
these symbols. It is easy to show, for example, that inferences
of the following form are valid:
<!--NewPage-->
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>P v Q
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
~P
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
______
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
so:   Q
</b>
</font>
<p>
(See for example Copi, <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> chapter
8.)
<p>
</blockquote>
Similarly, in predicate logic the quantifiers ('for all x', 'for
some x') may be explicitly defined by specifying certain rules
of inference to which they are to conform, like the rule of
'universal instantiation' (see Copi, chapter 10).
It is not nearly so easy to formulate semantic rules for
words in natural languages. In fact, for some words the task
would require much more than the resources of linguistics
and philosophy. The semantics of colour words ('red', '
vermilion', etc.) cannot be properly specified without reference
to the psychology and physiology of colour vision, for
example. The principles by which we interpret pictures,
diagrams and visual images may be just as hard to discover and
formulate.
<p>
If the semantic or interpretative rules for a language or
representational system have been articulated, it becomes
possible to accompany an inference using that language with
a commentary indicating why various steps are valid. A proof
with such a commentary may be said to be not only valid,
but also <i>rigorous.</i> So far relatively few systems are
sufficiently well understood for us to be able to formulate proofs
or inferences which are rigorous in this sense. Most of the
forms of reasoning which we use in our thinking and
communicating are not rigorous.
<p>
However, the fact that we cannot give the kind of
explanatory commentary which would make our inferences rigorous
does not imply that they are not <i>valid.</i> They may be perfectly
valid in the sense which I have defined. Moreover, we may
know that they are valid even if we cannot articulate the
reasons.
<p>
This is not to suggest that there are some inherently
mysterious and inexplicable processes in our thinking. I am only
saying that <i>so far</i> it has proved too difficult for us.
<p>
The use of representations to explain or demonstrate
possibilities is not directly covered by the preceding discussion.
However, all such cases seem to fit the following schema:
<p>
<blockquote>
Suppose R is a representation depicting or denoting W, where W is
an object, situation or process known to be possible in the world.
<p>
And suppose that Tr is a type of transformation of representations
which is known (or assumed) to correspond to a really possible
transformation Tw of things in the world. (See
<a href="#chap2">chapter 2</a>
on the aims of science for discussion of 'really possible'.)
<p>
Then, by applying Tr to
R, to get a new representation, R', which is interpretable as
representing an object, situation, or process W' we demonstrate that
W' is possible, if the assumptions stated are true.
</blockquote>
<p>
This seems to account for the chemical example and the use
of bits of cardboard to determine a possible layout of objects
in a room.
<p>
There are many problems left unsolved by all this. For
instance, there are problems about the 'scope' of particular
forms of inference. Are they <i>always</i> valid, or only in certain
conditions? How do we discover the limits of their validity?
(See Lakatos, 1976, for some relevant discussion in relation
to mathematics, and Toulmin, 1953, for discussions of the
use of diagrams in physics.) Does our ability to see the
validity of certain inference patterns depend on our using,
unconsciously, 'metalanguages' in which we formulate rules and
discoveries about the languages and representations we use?
<p>
Are children developing such metalanguages at the same time
as they develop overt abilities to talk, to draw and interpret
pictures, etc.? Questions like these can, or course, be asked
about inferences using verbal symbolisms too. (See Fodor,

7.10. What are analogical representations?
</I>
</b></h3>
Earlier, I introduced the idea of Fregean or applicative
symbolisms, and throughout the chapter have been using the
notion of an 'analogical' representation without ever having
given it a precise definition. I shall try to explain what I mean
by 'analogical' partly by contrasting it with 'Fregean'. I hope
thereby to clarify some of the things people have had in mind
in talking about 'iconic', 'non-verbal', 'intuitive', 'pictorial'
symbols and modes of thinking.
<p>
But experience has taught me that readers will project their
own presuppositions onto my definitions. So I should like to
stress a point which will be repeated later on, namely that
there is nothing in the idea of analogical representations which
requires them to be continuous (as opposed to discrete). Thus
there is nothing to prevent digital computers using analogical
representations. A less important source of confusion is the
prejudice that analogical representations must be isomorphic
with what they represent. This is by no means necessary, and
I shall illustrate this with two-dimensional drawings which
represent three-dimensional scenes.
<p>
The contrast between Fregean and analogical symbolisms
is concerned with the ways in which <i>complex</i> symbols work.
In both cases complex symbols have parts which are
significant, and significant relations between parts. Of course, the
parts and relations are not so much determined by the
physical nature of the symbol (for instance the ink marks or
picture on a piece of paper) as by the way the symbol is
analysed and interpreted by users. Only relative to a particular
way of using the symbol or representation does it have parts
and relations between parts. I shall take this for granted in
what follows.
<p>
In both Fregean and analogical representations, the
interpretation rules are such that what is denoted, or
represented, depends not only on the meanings of the parts but
also on how they are related. I shall start by saying
something about how Fregean symbolisms work. Their essential
feature is that all complex symbols are interpreted as
representing the application of functions to arguments. Here is a
simple example. According to Frege, a phrase like 'the brother
of the wife of Tom' should be analysed as having the
structure:
<p>


<font size="+1">
<pre><b>
             the brother of (|)
                             |
                             V
                            the wife of (|)
                                         |
                                         V
                                         Tom
</b></pre>
</font>

<p>
The function 'the wife of is applied to whatever is denoted
by 'Tom', producing as value some lady (if Tom is married),
and the function 'the brother of is applied to her, to
produce its own value (assuming Tom's wife has exactly one
brother). Thus the whole expression denotes whatever
happens to be the value of the last function applied.
<p>
Frege's analysis of the structures and functions of ordinary
language was complex and subtle, and I have presented only a
tiny fragment of it. For more details see the translations by
Geach and Black, and the items by Furth and Dummett in
the Bibliography. I shall not attempt to describe further
details here, except to point out that he analysed predicates
as functions from objects to truth-values, a notion now taken
for granted in many programming languages, and he analysed
quantifiers ('all', 'some', 'none', etc.) and sentential
connectives ('and', 'or', 'not', etc.) also as functions.
<p>
For present purposes it will suffice to notice that although
the complex Fregean symbol 'the brother of the wife of Tom'
has the word Tom' as a part, the thing it denotes (Tom's
brother-in-law) does not have Tom as a part. The structure of
a complex Fregean symbol bears no relation to the structure
of what it denotes, though it can be interpreted as
representing the <i>structure of a procedure for
identifying what is denoted.</i> In this case, the procedure is first of
all to identify
whatever is denoted by 'Tom', then use the relation 'wife of'
to identify someone else, then use the relation 'brother of' to
identify a third object: the final value. (See also my
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/03.html#200304">
<I>Tarski Frege, and the liar paradox</I>(1971).</a>
)
<p>
We could express this by saying that sometimes the
structure of a Fregean symbol represents the structure of a 'route
through the world' to the thing denoted. But this will not fit
all cases. For instance, in the arithmetical expression:


<font size="+1">
<pre><b>
                   <u>3x5 + 4x3</u>
                     11 - 2
</b></pre>
</font>

it is not plausible to say that the structure of the whole thing
represents a route through the world. However, given certain
conventions for grouping, it does represent the structure of a
rather elaborate procedure for finding the value denoted. The
procedure can also be represented by a tree:
<p>
<a name="fig7.tree"></a>
<center>
<font size="+1">
<b>
Figure 7.tree: A parse tree for an arithmetic expression
</b>
<p>
<img src="fig7.tree.gif" width="400" alt="[tree]" align=center>
</font>
</center>

(Notice that in interpreting the expression this way we are
using a convention about how expressions involving 'x' and
'+' should be 'bracketed'.) The tree-structured procedure is
executed by working up to the top of the tree from the
bottom. Left-right ordering of components does not signify a
temporal ordering in which the sums should be done. In some
sense we can say that the sub-expressions, for example, 1 I',
denote aspects of the procedure. But they do not denote
<i>parts</i> of what is denoted by the whole thing. An arithmetical
expression denoting the number three may contain a symbol
denoting the number eleven, but that does not imply that the
number eleven is in any sense part of the number three.
<p>
By contrast, analogical representations have parts which denote parts
of what they represent. Moreover, some properties of, and relations
between, the parts of the representation represent properties of and
relations between parts of the thing denoted.
<p>
So, unlike a Fregean symbol, an analogical representation has a
structure which gives information about the structure of the thing
denoted, depicted or represented.
<p>
This, then, is my definition of 'analogical'. It is important
to note that not ALL the properties and relations in an
analogical representation need be significant. For instance, in a
diagram the colour of the lines, their thickness, the chemical
properties of the paint used, and so on, need not be
meaningful. In a map (for instance maps of the London underground
railway system) there will often be lines whose precise lengths
and orientations do not represent lengths or orientations of
things in the world: only topological relations (order and
connectivity) are represented. This may be because a map
depicting more of the structure of the relevant bit of the
world would be less convenient to use. (Why?)
<p>
Further, the interpretation rules (semantic rules) need not
require that properties and relations within the representation
must always represent the same properties and relations of
parts of what is represented. The interpretation procedures
may be highly context-sensitive. For example, lines of the
same length in the scene may be depicted by lines of different
lengths in the picture. In figure 7.8 distances, or lengths, in the
picture represent distances in the scene in a complex
context-sensitive way. Further, lines of the same length in the picture
may depict different lengths in the scene.
<p>
<a name="fig7.8"></a>

<font size="+1">
<b>
Figure 7.8 Perspective picture
<p>
<img src="fig7.8.gif" width="450" alt="[walls]" align=center>
</b>
</font>
</center>

<p>
Moreover, the relation 'above', in the picture, may represent the relation
'above', or 'further', or 'nearer', or 'further and higher', depending on
whether bits of floor, wall, or ceiling are involved. This is connected with the
fact that parts of an analogical representation may be highly ambiguous if
considered in their own right. Only in the context of other parts is the
ambiguity removed. Much work in computer vision is concerned with the problem of
enabling global relations to  ' resolve local ambiguities. (See bibliography
references to Clowes and Waltz, and chapter 9.)
<p>
<a href="#fig7.8">Figure 7.8</a> also brings out clearly the fact that although
the structure of an analogical representation is related to the structure of
what it represents, there is no requirement that the two be <i>isomorphic.</i>
Indeed, they may have very different structures. In particular, Figure 7.8
is two
dimensional but represents a three-dimensional scene, whose structure is
therefore very different from that of the picture.
<p>
It should be obvious how to apply my definition of 'analogical'
to the sorts of pictures and diagrams used earlier to
illustrate inferences with analogical representations. However,
it turns out that the precise details of how to interpret
relations in a diagram are often surprisingly complicated.
Trying to program a computer to do the interpreting is
perhaps the best way of discovering the rules. Merely writing
down theoretical analyses, you are likely to get the rules
wrong. Embodying them in a program helps you to discover
that they do not work.

<h3><b>
<I>
7.11. Are natural languages Fregean?
</I>
</b></h3>
Frege was able to apply his function-argument analysis to a
wide variety of examples from German, and they transfer
easily to the English equivalents. However, not all the
complexity of natural language utterances is due to the
application of functions to arguments. For example, we often use
analogical representations either within sentences or in larger
structures, like stories. The order of words, phrases, or
sentences often depicts the order of things represented or
denoted by the words, etc. Tom, Dick and Harry stood
against the wall in that order.' 'He entered the room, saw the
body, gasped, and ran out screaming.'
<p>
This shows that there is no sharp verbal/analogical or
verbal/iconic distinction. A particular symbolism may include
both Fregean and analogical resources.
<p>
In modern programming languages this is very clear, since
there is a great deal of the usual function-application syntax
often mixed up with conventions that the order in which
instructions occur in a program represents the order in which
they are to be executed (and doing them in a different order
may produce quite different results).
So programming languages, like natural languages, are partly Fregean and
partly analogical. This is true even of a logic programming language
like Prolog.
<p>
But the Fregean/analogical distinction does not exhaust
the variety of important kinds of symbolising relations. For
example, in a program a symbol may occur which is merely a
label'  its sole function is to make it easy for other parts of
the program to refer to this bit, so that it does not depict
either a part of something represented by the whole program
nor a thing which is the argument to which a function is
applied. Elsewhere in the program may be an instruction to
jump to the location specified by this label. The occurrence
of such 'jump' instructions can badly upset the
correspondence between order of instructions in the program and the
time order of events in which the instructions are executed,
making programs hard to understand and modify.
<p>
The kind of self-referring metalinguistic role of labels in a
computer program is clearly something different from the
kinds of representation I have called Fregean and analogical.
<p>
Natural languages also use self-reference, for instance when
the expressions 'the former' and 'the latter' direct attention
to order of phrases in a text. They have many other devices
which do not fit neatly into these two categories. For
example, it is not easy to give a Fregean analysis of adverbial
phrases ('He came into the room, singing, leaning heavily on
a stick, and dragging the sofa behind him'). So I am not
claiming that I have given anything like a complete survey of
types of representation. I doubt whether such a thing is
possible: for one aspect of human creativity is the invention of
new sorts of symbolisms.
<p>
One conclusion which may be drawn from all this is that
neurophysiologists, psychologists, and popular science
journalists who take seriously the idea that one half of the human
brain deals with verbal skills and the other half with pictorial
and other non-verbal skills are simply showing how naive they
are about verbal and non-verbal symbolisms. Presumably,
when they learn that besides Fregean and analogical
symbolisms there are other sorts, they will have to find a way of
dividing the brain into more than two major portions. As for
how we deal with combined uses of the two sorts of
symbolisms, no doubt it will prove necessary to find a bit of the
brain whose function is to integrate the other bits!
(Programmers know that there need not be a localised bit of the
computer which corresponds to sub-abilities of a complex
program.)

<I>
7.12. Comparing Fregean and analogical representations
</I>
</b></h3>
Philosophers of science who acknowledge that scientists and
mathematicians often use diagrams, models, images, and
other non-verbal representations, sometimes claim that this
fact is of no philosophical importance. It is a mere empirical
fact, of interest to psychologists, but not relevant to
philosophical studies of what is 'rational' in scientific methods.
<p>
The implication is that the use of non-logical methods of
inference, and the choice of analogical representations is an
irrational, or at best non-rational, piece of behaviour.
Scientists are behaving rationally only when they perform logical
deductions from theories and when they use observation and
experiment to discover whether certain sentences express
truths or falsehoods.
<p>
Against this view I shall argue that it is sometimes quite
rational to choose to use an analogical rather than a Fregean
method of representation. That is, there are often good
reasons for the choice, given the purposes for which
representations are used, which include storing information for future
use, guiding the search for good solutions to problems,
enabling new versions of previously encountered situations to
be recognized, and so on.
I do not claim that analogical representations are
<I>
always
</I>
best.
<p>
If one were designing a robot to be a scientist, or more
generally to play the role of a person, it would be advisable,
for some purposes, to program the robot to store information
in an analogical representation, and to perform inferences by
manipulating analogical representations. (See Funt 1977 for
a description of a program which solves mechanics problems
with the aid of analogical representations.) So it is not merely
an empirical fact that people do this too. Of course, neither
people nor robots could possibly function with only
analogical representations. Any intelligent system will have to
use a wide variety of different types of representation and
different types of reasoning strategy. But how can we
decide which ones to use for which purposes? There are no
simple answers.
<p>
Fregean systems have the great advantage that the
structure (syntax) of the expressive medium does not constrain
the variety of configurations which can be described or
represented. So the same general rules of formation, denotation
and inference can apply to Fregean languages dealing with a
very wide range of domains. The formula
<b>P(a,b,c)</b>, or its
English variants, like
<b>'a is P to b and c'</b>, can be used for
applying a predicate to three arguments no matter what kind of
predicate it is, nor what sorts of things are referred to by the
argument symbols. The following assertions use the same
Fregean structure despite being concerned with quite
different domains:
<b>
<blockquote>
Between(London, Brighton, Cambridge)
<br>
Greater-by (three, twelve, nine)
<br>
Joins(coupling, truck 1, truck 2)
</blockquote>
</b>
Contrast the difficulty (or impossibility) of devising a single
two-dimensional analogical system adequate for representing
chemical, musical, social, and mechanical processes. Fregean
systems make it possible to think about very complex states
of affairs involving many different kinds of objects and
relations at once. For each type of property or relation a new
symbol can be introduced as a predicate (that is, a function
which, when applied to objects as arguments, yields the result
TRUE or the result FALSE). The syntax for making assertions
or formulating questions using all these different symbols is
the same. There is no need to invent new arrangements of the
symbols to cope with a new kind of domain.
<p>
The price of this topic-neutrality, or generality, is that it
becomes hard to invent procedures for dealing efficiently
with specific problems. Very often, searching for the solution
to a problem is a matter of searching for a combination of
symbols representing something with desired properties. For
instance it may be a search for a plan of action which will
achieve some goal, or a search for a representation of an
arrangement of objects in a room, or a search for a
representation of a route between two places which is shorter
than
alternative routes. For a frequently encountered class of
problems it may be advantageous to use a more specialised
representation, richer in problem-solving power than a
Fregean symbolism.
<p>
What makes one representation better than another? To
say that it is easier for humans, or that people are more familiar
with it is not to give an explanation. An adequate explanation
must analyse the structure of the symbolism and show its
relationship to the purposes for which it is used, the context of
use, and the problems generated by its use. This is often very
hard to do, since it is hard to become conscious of the ways
we are using symbols. I shall try, in the rest of this section, to
give a brief indication of the sort of analysis that is required.
<p>
A method of representation may possess problem-solving
power, relative to a domain, for a number of different reasons.
<ol type="a">
<li>It may have a syntax which makes it impossible to waste
time exploring unfruitful combinations of symbols.
<p><li>It may permit transformations which are significantly
related to transformations in what is denoted, so that sets of
possibilities can be explored exhaustively and economically.
<p><li>It may provide a useful 'addressing' structure, so that
mutually relevant items of information are located in
the representation in such a way that it is easy (using
appropriate procedures) to access one of them starting
from the other.
<p><li>It may provide an economic use of space, so that there's
lots of room for adding new information or building
temporary representations while exploring possible ways
of solving a problem. Economy in use of space may also
reduce the time taken to search for what is needed.
<p><li>The representation may make it easy to alter or add to
information stored, as new facts are learnt or old
information is found to be mistaken or no longer necessary.
<p><li>The system used may facilitate comparisons of two
representations, to find out whether they represent the
same thing, and, if not, how exactly they differ.
<p><li>The representation may facilitate the process of '
debugging', that is tracking down the source of the difficulty
when use of the representation leads to errors or
disappointments.
<p><li>The representation may allow similar methods of
inference< and problem-solving to be used in more than one
domain, so that solutions to problems in one domain
generate solutions to problems in another domain.
</ol>
<p>
These form just a subset of the problems about adequacy
of representations which have had to be faced by people
working in artificial intelligence. (See Hayes, 1974, Bobrow,
1975, Minsky, 1975.) The subject is still in its infancy, and
criteria for adequacy of representations are only beginning to
be formulated. The sorts of issues which arise can be
illustrated by the following list of properties of analogical
representations which often make them useful:
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is often less risk of generating a representation
which lacks a denotation. In Fregean systems, as in
ordinary language, 'failure of reference' is a
commonplace. That is, syntactically well-formed expressions
often turn out not to be capable of denoting anything,
even though they adequately express procedures for
attempting to identify a referent. Examples are 'the
largest prime number' (which fails to refer for reasons presented by Euclid),
'the polygon with three sides and
four corners', 'my bachelor uncle who is an only child'.
<p>
In analogical systems it seems that a smaller proportion
of well-formed representations can be uninterpretable
(inconsistent). This is because the structure of the
medium, or the symbolism used, permits only a limited
range of configurations. Pictures of impossible objects
are harder to come by than Fregean descriptions of
impossible objects. This means that searches are less
likely to waste time exploring blind alleys.

<p><li>In an analogical representation, small changes in the
representation (syntactic changes) are likely to
correspond to small changes in what is represented (semantic
changes). We are relying on this fact when we use a map
to search for a short route between two towns, and start
by drawing, or imagining, a straight line joining the two
towns, then try to deform the line by relatively small
amounts so as to make it fit along roads on the map.
<p>
(This is not as simple a process as it sounds.) By contrast,
the differences in the forms of words describing objects
which differ in shape or size may not be related in
magnitude to the differences in the objects. The
difference between the words 'two' and 'ten', for example, is
in no sense greater than the difference between 'two'
and 'three', or 'nineteen' and 'twenty'. 'Circle' and
'square' are not more different in their form than
'rectangle' and 'square'. So substitution of one word for
another in a description need not make a symbolic
change which is usefully related to the change in
meaning. In particular, this means that the notation does not
provide an aid to ordering sets of possibilities so that
they can be explored systematically.

<p><li>Closely related to the previous point is the fact that
constraints in a problem situation (the route cannot go
through a wall, a lever cannot bend, the centres of
pulleys have a fixed position) may, in an analogical
representation, be easily expressed by constraints on the
kinds of syntactic transformations which may be applied
to the representation. Thus large numbers of possibilities
do not have to be generated and then rejected after
interpreting them. So 'search spaces' may be more
sensibly organised.

<p><li>Often in an analogical representation it is possible to
store a great many facts about a single item in a
relatively economical way. Each part of a map is related to
many other parts, and this represents a similar plethora
of relationships in the terrain represented. Using a map
we can 'get at' all the relationships involving a particular
town through a single 'access point', for example a single
dot. If the same collection of relationships were stored
in sentences, then for each significant place there would
be many sentences referring to it, and this would
normally require a large number of repeated occurrences of
the name of that place.
<p>
Sometimes there are devices for
abbreviating sentences repeating a single word, by using
'and' to conjoin phrases, for example, but one could not
get rid of all repetitions of place names like this. If the
sentences are stored in a list of assertions, then in order
to find all the facts concerning any one place it is
necessary to search for all the sentences naming it. For some
places it is possible to collect together all the sentences
concerning them, but since such sentences will generally
mention lots of other places too, we cannot collect all
the facts about a place under one heading, simultaneously
for all places, without an enormous amount of repetition.
This problem is avoided in a map.
<p>
The same effect as a map can be achieved in a
computer data-structure by associating with all objects a set
of 'pointers' to all the stored assertions about them, that
is, a list of addresses at which assertions are stored in the
machine. The facts do not then need to be repeated for
all the objects they mention. This sort of technique can
lead to the use of structures, within the computer, which
include relationships representing relationships in the
world. Programmers often make their programs use
analogical representations because of the efficiency achieved
thereby.

<p><li>Closely related to the previous point is the fact that it is
often possible in an analogical representation to represent
important changes in the world by relatively simple
changes in the representation. For instance, if buttons or
other markers on a map represent positions of objects,
then moving the buttons represents changes in the world.
<p>
From the new configuration the new relationships
between objects (which ones are near to which others,
which are north of others, etc.) are as easily 'read off as
before the alteration. By contrast, if instead of
representing all the initial representations by location on a map,
we make a lot of assertions about their relationships,
then for each change of position a large number of
changes will have to be made in the stored assertions. Of
course, this problem can be minimised if we have some
way of recording position without doing it in terms of
relations to all the other objects, for instance by storing
a pair of co-ordinates (latitude and longitude). This also
requires good methods for inferring relationships from
such stored positional information. Notice incidentally
that the use of Cartesian co-ordinates to represent
position, and more generally the use of algebraic methods
in geometry, involves using sets of numbers as an
analogical representation for sets of locations on a line
that is, order relations and size relations between
numbers represent order relations and distance relations.

<I>
7.13. Conclusion
</I>
</b></h3>
When an early version of this chapter was published in 1971, many readers
thought I was trying to prove that analogical representations are always better
or intrinsically better than Fregean ones. That would be absurd.
<p>
I have been trying to show that questions about which form of representation
should be used can be discussed rationally in the light of the purposes for
which they are to be used and the problems and advantages of using them. In some
circumstances, analogical representations have advantages.
<p>
The problem of deciding on the relative merits of different
ways of representing the same information plays a role in the
development of science, even if scientists are not consciously
thinking about these issues. Similarly a child must be
acquiring not only new facts and skills but new ways of representing
and organising its knowledge. Very little is currently known
about such processes, but the attempt to design machines
which learn the sorts of things which people can learn is
helping to highlight some of the problems.
<p>
The issues are complicated by the fact that one type of
representation can provide a medium within which to embed
or 'implement' another (see Hayes, 1974). For instance, by
using a suitable method of indexing statements in a Fregean
language we can get the effect of an analogical representation,
as I have already indicated in discussing maps. Another
example is the use of two-dimensional arrays to represent
two-dimensional images in a computer. There is not really
any two-dimensional object accessed by the program, rather
a linear chunk of the computer's memory is organised in such
a way that with the aid of suitable programs the user can
treat it as if it were a two dimensional configuration
addressable by a pair of co-ordinates. (Actually the physical memory
of the computer is not really linear  but it is interpreted as
a linear sequence of locations by mechanisms in the computer.)
<p>
In <a href="#chap8">Chapter 8</a> on learning about numbers, I give examples of
the use of lots of linked pairs of addresses to build up data-structures which
in part function as analogical representations, insofar as the order of numbers
is represented by the order of symbols representing them. This is another
example of one sort of representation being embedded in another.
<p>
Computer programs can be given the ability to record and
analyse some of their own actions. There will generally be a
limit to what a program knows about how it works, however.
For instance, programs cannot normally find out whether
they are running on a computer made of transistors or some
other kind.
<p>

<div style="margin-left:10px; margin-top:-10px; margin-bottom:10px;">
(<b>Note added 8 Feb 2016:</b>
<br>
That could be false if the machine has an
instruction to report such information if interrogated by a program. Even if
that is not the case, the growth of the internet and the availability of "search
engines" could allow a resourceful program to gain information about its host
computer via the internet, much as we now gain information about our brains
via the internet, after someone else has done the required research.)
</div>
Similarly, a program may be able to record, and
discuss the fact that it is accessing and modifying a
two-dimensional array, or moving along a linear list of some kind,
without being able to tell how the array or list is actually
represented in the computer. So a program could be under
the illusion that it is building and manipulating things which
are very like two-dimensional pictures on paper, or very like
physical rows of objects, not knowing that really it is using
scattered fragments of an abstract address space managed by
complex storage allocation routines and accessed by
procedures designed to hide the implementation details.
<p>
When such a system is asked about its own mental
processes, it could well give very misleading accounts of how
they work. Phenomenologically, of course, it could not but
be accurate. But it would not give accurate <i>explanations</i> of
its abilities, only <i>descriptions</i> of what it does. No doubt
people are in a similar position when they try to reflect on
their own thinking and reasoning processes. In particular, we
see that very little explanatory power can be attached to
what people say about how they solve tasks set for them by
experimental psychologists interested in imagery.
<p>
One moral of all this is that often a discussion of the
relative merits of two kinds of representation needs to take
account of how the representations are actually constructed
and what sorts of procedures for using them are tacitly
assumed to be available. (For further discussion, see Hayes,
1974, Sloman, 1975.)
<p>
Very many problems have been left unsolved by this
discussion. In particular, it is proving quite hard to give
computers the ability to perceive and to manipulate pictures and
diagrams to the extent that people do. This is an indication
of how little we currently understand about how we do this.

of understanding how human vision works. Likewise, any satisfactory

explanation of how visual reasoning works. <a href="#chap9">Chapter 9</a>

the AISB Summer conference, in July 1974, at The University of Sussex.
<div style="margin-left:15px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Aaron Sloman (1974),

<p>
Most of the content was inspired by my interactions with Benjamin Sloman
while he was learning to think about numbers, aged about 5 years,
during a year (1972-3) when I was visiting the University of Edinburgh,
aged about 36. I was learning to think about information structures,
programs and architectures while he was learning to think about
numbers (and many other things.)
<p>
We both learnt an enormous amount that year. Trying to understand
his development, and ways in which it could be influenced (programmed?)
helped to convince me that AI was at least <I>beginning</I> to produce theories
of the right general sort, though still lacking in detail and
comprehensiveness.
<p>

<i>
8.1. Introduction
</i>
</b></h3>
The aim of this chapter is both methodological and tutorial.
It should help to introduce readers to some computing ideas.
It also includes some theoretical speculations about learning
and memory. These speculations are fairly complex, yet it is
clear that they are too simple-minded to be adequate
accounts of how children perform their astonishing feats of
learning. At most, I hope to indicate part of a route to future explanatory
models.
Many more questions will be asked than answered.
And answers offered will be tentative and provisional.
Unfortunately, experienced programmers will find some of the
explanations below very tedious and over-simplified. I
apologise to them, and hope that non-programmers will not find
the same explanations too difficult!
<p>
Here is a typical conversation with a child aged between
three and a half and five years.

<blockquote>
Adult: Can you count up to twenty?
<p>
Child: One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen seventeen eighteen twenty.
<p>
A: What comes after three?
<p>
C: One two three four --- four.
<p>
A: What comes after eight?
<p>
C: Four
<p>
A: What comes after six?
<p>
C: Don't know
<p>
A: What comes before two?
<p>
C: One
<p>
A: What comes before four?
<p>
C: Five
<p>
A: How many fingers on my hand?
<p>
C (counting fingers): One two three four five
<p>
A: What's two and three?
<p>
C (counting fingers): One two  three four five. Five.
</blockquote>

Does this child grasp number concepts? Perhaps there is
something wrong with the question, because number concepts are
not simple things which you have either grasped or not
grasped?
<p>
What are number concepts? How is it possible for them to
be learnt? How is it possible for them to be used? How is it
possible to discover non-empirical facts about them? I believe
we are not yet able to formulate adequate answers to these
questions. What follows is offered as a preliminary
exploration of some of the issues.
<p>
The method illustrated in this chapter is an example of the main point argued in
<a href="#chap2">(Chapter 2)</a>, namely that a major aim of science is to find
out what sorts of things are possible and to explain how they are possible, i.e.
what makes them possible. We all know a great deal about what it is possible for
adults and children to do with numbers. So, instead of collecting facts by doing
experiments on children, we can generate requirements for explanatory theories
by reflecting on the fine-structure of already familiar human abilities. In
other words, methods of conceptual analysis, typically practised by philosophers
and linguists, can be an important source of data for psychology.
(<a href="#chap4">Chapter 4</a> provided an introduction to conceptual
analysis. This chapter extends those techniques.)
<p>
I am not suggesting that conceptual analysis suffices to
reveal everything we would like to know about, for example,
ordinary counting abilities. The claim is only that it is foolish
to embark on expensive empirical investigations before
making a serious and systematic effort to articulate what you
already know about the subject matter.
<p>
Here are some of the questions for which answers are lacking:
<ul>
<li>
What exactly is it that a child learns in learning about
numbers?
<li>
How is it possible for different fragments of the
same number-system to be mastered by different people?
<li>
How far does learning about numbers depend on very general
learning abilities, and how far are the hurdles and mechanisms specific to
numbers?
<li>
How is it that a child who already seems to have the
knowledge to answer a question or solve a problem, is often
unable to use that knowledge?
<li>
What enables the knowledge
to be accessed at some later time?
<li>
How can a child learn new
truths about what she already knows, for instance learning
that two of the numbers she has learnt add up to a third
number she knows, or that two different additions generate
the same result, or that some procedure (e.g. adding one)
can be repeated indefinitely to yield larger and larger
numbers?
</ul>
<p>
I shall try to show how thinking about such apparently
psychological questions can lead towards new answers to old
philosophical problems about the nature of numbers, thereby
providing further support for the claim that academic barriers
between philosophy and science are artificial, (Some implications
regarding information processing architectures for intelligent systems
will emerge as a side-effect.)

<h3><b>
<I>
8.2. Philosophical slogans about numbers
</I>
</b></h3>
Here are some examples of philosophers'
answers to the question 'What are numbers?', and related
questions:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Numbers are non-physical mind-independent entities,
existing in their own realm which is different from the
world of spatial objects. (Platonists)
<p>
<li>Numbers are perceivable properties of groups of objects.
For example, the number three is what is <i>visibly</i> common
to the two groups
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>* * *</b>
</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>
<b>$ $ $</b>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
(Aristotle? Many psychologists?)
<p>
<li>Numbers are mental objects, created by human mental
processes. Facts about numbers are discovered by
performing mental experiments. (Kant(?), and the Intuitionist
mathematicians)
<p>
<li>Numbers are sets of sets, or predicates of predicates,
definable in purely logical terms. An example of this view:
the number one is the set of all sets capable of being
mapped bi-uniquely onto the set containing nothing but
the empty set. (Frege, Russell, and other logicists)
<p>
<li>Numbers are meaningless symbols manipulated
according to arbitrary rules. Mathematical discoveries are merely
discoveries about the properties of this game with symbols.
(Formalists)
<p>
<li>Numbers are implicitly defined by a collection of
axioms, such as Peano's axioms. Any collection of things
satisfying these axioms can be called a set of numbers. The
nature of the elements of the set is irrelevant. Mathematical
discoveries about numbers are merely discoveries of logical
consequences of the axioms. (Many mathematicians)
<p>
<li>There is no one correct answer to the question 'what are
numbers?' People play a motley of 'games' using number
words and other symbols, and a full account of the nature
of numbers would simply be an analysis of these games
(including the activity of mathematicians) and the roles
they play in our lives. (Wittgenstein:
<I>Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics</I>)
</ol>
For more details, see standard texts on philosophy of
mathematics. I believe that more or less articulate versions of these
philosophical theories, play an important role in many
psychological and educational theories about numbers. (I
have formed this opinion over many years, from wide but
unsystematic reading and discussion, including attendance at
lectures and seminars. So I am not in a position to document
the claim. I shall continue in this chapter to make remarks
about psychological theories -- if the disparaging remarks are
untrue I'll be delighted).
<p>
All the views listed above combine elements of truth with distortions and
oversimplifications. I think that Wittgenstein came close, but got important
details wrong. In his writings he formulates many problems about
mathematics, which are not answered by other theories, but his own solutions
seem to me to be too shallow. In particular, the anti-mentalism, or
anti-psychologism, which pervades much of his writing prevents him from
discussing mental processes in any depth. So he writes as if thinking about
numbers were essentially a <i>social</i> process, i.e. implicitly referring to
certain social practices, consistently with his conclusion in <i>Philosophical
Investigations</i> that <i>all</i> rule-following is an essentially social
process, dependent on the existence of a public language.
<p>
This conflicts with a computational analysis of mental
processes, according to which it is perfectly possible for a
non-social mechanism to contain within itself rules which
it can obey, for instance, programs transmitted genetically.
<p>
Wittgenstein's position also conflicts with any sensible
account of the biological evolution of mental processes in
precursors <i>of homo sapiens.</i>
<p>
I think Kant was correct in saying that mathematicians discover truths about
numbers that are not trivial (logical) consequences of definitions (i.e. they
are <i>synthetic</i>, not <i>analytic</i> truths), but it is possible to
understand why they cannot have exceptions in remote parts of the planet, or the
universe, but are not <i>innate</i> and have to be discovered through
<i>experience</i> of doing mathematics. This depends on an ability that appears
to be unique to humans (on this planet) to reflect on aspects of how we come to
know what we know, though simple cases of such abilities can be implemented in
computers that prove mathematical theorems.
<p>
I am not going to try to solve all the philosophical and
psychological problems about numbers in one chapter. I shall
merely try to show how we can get important new insights
into the problems, and perhaps take some small steps towards
formulating possible answers, if we think about the mental
processes and mechanisms as if they were analogous to the
processes and mechanisms involved in so-called
'list-processing' computer programs. Adequate exploration of
these issues has been hampered by the current separation of
philosophy and psychology, and the ignorance among most
philosophers and psychologists of computing ideas.
<blockquote>

<b>Note added 11 Feb 2016</b>
<br>
As will be clear from the rest of this chapter, a core feature of the "games"
involved in understanding numbers is the use of one-to-one correspondences
between different collections of discrete items. These can be collections of
various kinds, including collections of physical objects, collections of events,
collections of names, collections of locations, and many more. Piaget
<a href="#piaget-number">[1952]</a> understood this well, unlike some other
researchers who have done research on number competences more recently, for
example confusing an understanding of numbers with pattern-recognition
capabilities shown by ability to label small collections using number names.
More detailed requirements for a scientific understanding of number competences
are included in the rest of this chapter and notes added in 2016,
below:

</blockquote>
<p>
I shall not be talking about events or processes or mechanisms in the human
brain. Exactly how the brain works is as irrelevant to our problems as the
detailed workings of a computer are to an explanation of a computer program
written in a high-level programming language. There may be creatures on other
planets, or robots, whose brains are totally unlike ours in their physiological
details, yet such beings could well learn about numbers, and learn the same
concepts as we do, just as two computers with quite different physical
components can execute the same 'high-level' programs. (Incidentally, this
undermines philosophical theories which claim that mental processes are
identical with brain processes. This is as inaccurate as the claim that
computational processes in a computer are identical with the physical
processes in which they are implemented.)
<p>
When I talk about mechanisms involved in using numbers,
I am not talking about physiological mechanisms. I am talking
about aspects of the way information is organised and
represented, and about the kinds of symbol-manipulating
processes which may be necessary for accessing and using
various sorts of representations. In particular, such processes
involve the following of rules, instructions, or plans, whether
consciously or unconsciously.
<p>
This illustrates how the concept of 'mechanism' is extended
by developments in computing.
<a name="8.3."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
8.3. Some assumptions about memory
</I>
</b></h3>
Unfortunately, my speculations about mental processes will
be intelligible only if I introduce some technical ideas and
assumptions, already hinted at in previous chapters, especially
chapter 6. If the assumptions are wrong, then quite different
theories are required. At the moment, there does not seem to
be any way of avoiding these assumptions, if we are trying to
explain well-known facts about what people can do.
<p>
The main assumption is that we can speak of the human
mind as storing information in a vast collection of locations.
They need not be spatial locations, like shelves in a library.
Positions in any kind of symbolic space with appropriate
mechanisms for storing and retrieving information will do. So
the word 'location' is being used as a technical term. For
instance, radio waves are often used to transmit information,
different information being transmitted at different
frequencies. So information could be stored in a collection of
continually reverberating radio waves, with different symbols
stored at different frequencies. Each possible frequency
would then be a location in the sense required here.
<p>
Similarly, possible structures of a certain class of molecules
could define 'addresses' in a space. Storing information at a
certain address would mean attaching that information to
molecules with the structure represented by the address. This
could be done more or less simultaneously in many different
physical places. But the information would still be stored in
one symbolic place, just as a name occurs at only one
symbolic location in a telephone directory, even though there
may be millions of physically distinct copies of the directory
containing the name. So from now on, when I talk about
locations, this is neutral as to what sorts of locations they are.
<p>
I shall assume then that a mechanism is available which can
store symbols in some 'space' of locations. Further, I assume
that it is possible for some of the symbols to represent
locations in this space. (For instance, a directory, or catalogue,
can contain entries which refer to the location' of other
entries, by page or section number.) Thus the space can
contain information about itself.
<p>
A symbol representing a location can be called a 'pointer',
functioning as an 'address'. So the storage mechanism can be given the
address of a location and asked to produce the symbol located there. In
other words, when given a pointer, it can determine what
symbol is pointed at. What is pointed at may be a complex
structure containing a symbol which is itself an address of some
other location, that is a pointer to another symbol. (See
<a href="#fig8.1">Figure 8.1.</a>) So the space may contain chains of
pointers. (In
more elaborate systems, the addressing may be relative to a
context or mode of operation. That is, which location is
represented by a given symbol may depend on the current state
of the accessing sub-mechanism. Some of the flexibility of
behaviour of the system may depend on such systematic
changes in the 'meaning' of symbols.)
<p>
The concept of a symbolic structure containing pointers
into itself, and the investigation of processes in which such
things are manipulated and used for solving problems, are
among the important contributions of computing science. I
shall try to show how these ideas help us to think about a
child's ability to count, an ability which provides the
substratum for a grasp of number concepts.
<p>
The first task is to make explicit some of our
commonsense knowledge about the sorts of things we can do with
number words and number concepts. Note the 'can': it is
<i>possibilities</i> we most need to explain, not <i>laws</i>, that is not
<i>regularities</i> or <i>correlations</i>. We know relatively few non-trivial
laws of human behaviour. But we know of very many human
possibilities, namely, many things at least some people can
do. By thinking about possible mechanisms underlying fairly
common abilities we can reveal the poverty of most philosophical and
psychological theories about the nature of mathematical concepts and
knowledge. These theories do not account for the fine-structure of what
we all know. All this illustrates methodological points made in
<a href="#chap2">Chapter 2</a> and <a href="#chap3">Chapter 3.</a>
<p>
<a name="8.4."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
8.4. Some facts to be explained
</I>
</b></h3>
Piaget grasped the importance of understanding 1-1 correspondences in
understanding the natural numbers (<a href="#piaget-number">Piaget [1952]</a>).
He also showed experimentally that there are various types of <b>incomplete</b>
understanding of properties of 1-1 correspondences (e.g. how they are invariant
to various kinds of spatial rearrangement). As a result, he was able to show
that there are various kinds of <b>partial</b> understanding of numbers in
children.
<p>
None of this is relevant to the <b>perceptual</b> conception of number which
involves only a comparatively primitive form of pattern recognition capability
(based on some sort of template matching mechanism). That ability should not be
confused with having any concept of cardinal or ordinal number, though it often
is, e.g. in experiments mistakenly taken as determining whether human infants or
other animals have a concept of number. I doubt that any neuroscientist has any
idea what sorts of brain mechanisms support the fully developed mathematical
concept of 1-1 correspondence and the associated concepts of cardinal and
ordinal numbers, along with abilities to discover necessary truths about
numbers.
<br>
[Compare the ability to think about impossible spatial configurations:

<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/impossible.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/impossible.html</a>]
<p>
When this chapter was written (originally around 1974) the aim was merely to
describe how a <b>subset</b> of the competences might be implemented in certain
sorts of computational mechanisms, including mechanisms for running two
concurrent processes supervised by a third process, and mechanisms for recording
some of the structural patterns found in such processes. However, this is still
a very long way from a set of mechanisms supporting a full understanding of
number including the ability to discover necessary consequences of applying
the procedures.
<p>
<a name="not-addressed"></a>
<blockquote>
<b>Note added Feb 2016: Topics not addressed here</b>
<br>
When I wrote this chapter I had assumed that all readers would have some
familiarity with the connections between cardinal numbers and 1-1
correspondences, discussed in detail by Frege, Russell, and Piaget, among
others. In particular Piaget (who had read Frege and Russell on foundations of
arithmetic)
provided evidence for several intermediate
stages between learning to count and fully grasping the connections between
number concepts and 1-1 correspondences. For example understanding that
mere spatial rearrangements of objects cannot affect a 1-1 correspondence
between two sets of objects may be delayed until the 5th or 6th year.
(<a href="#piaget-number">Piaget,1952</a>).
Some of the topics related to this that were mentioned very briefly, but not
discussed in the original version of this chapter are listed below
in <a href="#note-ch-8-20160217">Notes added 17 Feb 2016</a>.
<p>
Compare the work of Wiese mentioned

</blockquote>

Reflecting on even the simplest things we know children can
learn (although not all children learn all of them) shows that
children can somehow cope with quite complex problems of
storing, using and manipulating symbols, that is,
computational problems. Some of these problems are common to
many forms of learning, others peculiar to counting.
<p>
I shall start with problems involved in learning number
words. These problems are common to all words. Next, there
are problems concerned with the fact that number words
form a <i>sequence</i> to be memorised. Some of the problems are
common to many other sequences, for instance letters of the
alphabet, digits in telephone numbers, the letters used to
spell a word, sequences of sub-actions making up a learnt
action (a dance-routine, or a method for testing faulty
engines). Finally, I shall mention some problems peculiar to
numbers, without offering more than tiny steps towards
solutions.
<p>
There are many facts about number concepts and the ways
in which they are used that I shall not attempt to analyse or
explain. For instance, I shall say nothing about our ability to
learn to generate an indefinitely extendable set of
number names in a systematic fashion, or our ability to learn to think
algebraically about numbers, for example in proving general
truths about adding, subtracting, multiplying, etc., without
mention of particular numbers.
<p>
In unravelling some of the hidden complexities in even the
simplest abilities, I hope to give a feeling for the even greater
complexities still to be explored. The intellectual tasks
accomplished by ordinary children in apparently simple
activities are comparable in complexity to some of the mental
processes of adult scientists, engineers and artists. The
children merely have less knowledge to build on.
<p>
If children have these impressive powers, why don't they
use them to learn about arithmetic, reading, music,
painting, and so on, without formal schooling, just as they learn
to walk, talk and manipulate objects without formal
schooling?
<p>
Perhaps the answer is that despite all the variations in parental behaviour and
home environment, nearly all children are placed in situations where learning to
talk, walk, etc. are essential for them to achieve things they are highly
motivated to do (like eating and interacting with other people), and moreover
there are well-structured opportunities for them to learn, even though they
learn things at different rates and in different orders.
<p>
By contrast, very few parents and teachers are able to provide similarly highly
structured and highly motivating situations to generate learning about reading,
writing, mathematics, science, music, history, etc. One of the difficulties of
investigating such issues without good theories of learning is that there are so
many different factors which can make a difference in subtle ways. (Selfe 1977

8.5. Knowing number words
</I>
</b></h3>
How is it possible for a child to learn to recognise sounds, like
'one', 'two', 'three', etc.? A simple-minded answer is that
repeated exposure causes the sounds to be stored so that they
can be reproduced and new occurrences recognised by
matching them with stored ones. Immediately all sorts of questions
need to be asked. In what form is
the sound represented, that is, what exactly is stored? Is the
sound analysed into recognisable fragments, such as phonemes?
How are they recognised? Is some symbolic description of the
sound stored, for example a description of the components of
the sound? How does the child cope with variations in the
sound? For instance, we may hear the same word produced
by different people, or by the same person with different
intonation contours or different pronunciations.
<p>
Does the stored description cope with all variations by
making use of relatively abstract specifications (whatever that
means)? Or does the child store different descriptions
corresponding to different ways the sound may be uttered? In the
former case, how does the child learn to use descriptions with
sufficient generality, and in the latter case how does she
represent the fact that the different descriptions are of <i>the same</i> word?
<p>
Or is some other method used to cope with variations, such
as storing a specific description (a description of a 'prototype'
or 'template'), and using a flexible matching procedure so
that things not quite like it will match anyway? (This kind of
'sloppy matching' is often useful in computer programs.) Or,
as Kant suggested in his discussion of schemata, do we cope
with variations by using rules or procedures for synthesis and
analysis rather than stored templates or descriptions? For
instance, a rule which says 'count the number of consecutive
occurrences of "ho" in an utterance and if the result is above
two then call it a laugh' can enable one to recognize laughs'
of very varied lengths. (I am not suggesting, and neither was
Kant, that these matching and testing processes are conscious.
In any case, we know so little about the difference between
what we are and are not conscious of, that we cannot draw
any useful conclusions from the fact that they are mostly
unconscious processes.)

<h3><b>
<I>
8.6. Problems of very large knowledge stores
</I>
</b></h3>
We know that children learn many things. It is arguable that,
using any reasonable method of counting facts, they learn
millions, or at least hundreds of thousands of facts about
possible appearances of things, about sounds, about possible
movements, etc., in the first year or two. Given that there is
a vast store of known items in a child's mind when she hears
a word, what sort of process can quickly decide (not
necessarily consciously) whether the word just heard matches
something previously stored? Clearly a linear search through a list
is out of the question, unless human minds have mechanisms
which can work at far greater speeds than computers, which
seems very unlikely. When listening to something quite novel,
how does one decide, without searching the whole collection
of stored items, that the sound just heard <i>does not</i> match
anything already known?
<p>
These problems can be dealt with if the child not only
stores items, but also builds appropriate indexes to what it
knows. For instance we use alphabetically ordered indexes to
help us search books, libraries, department-stores, etc. (How?
Think about how you might teach a child or a computer to
use an alphabetic ordering to avoid a complete linear search.)
What sorts of indexing techniques do children use, and how
are they able to use them? Are we born with some
sophisticated indexing strategies? Is it possible that children
unconsciously use some kind of ordered set of symbols, like an
alphabet, and build 'alphabetically' ordered or tree-structured
catalogues of what they know, to minimise searches?
<p>
Librarians and computer scientists do not find it easy to
design good methods of cataloguing and indexing. Children
must be much more sophisticated, although unconsciously.
<div style="margin-left:20px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">
This is one of many examples of computationally sophisticated products of
biological evolution, without which intelligent animals would not be able to
function as they do. Researchers who lack personal experience of designing,
implementing, testing, debugging, and extending such computational mechanisms
are unlikely to be able to design experiments to test for their existence, or
precise theories about how the mechanisms might be implemented in animal brains.
</div>
<p>
Why don't we (and children) learn things permanently as
soon as we hear them? Why is repeated hearing sometimes
needed for learning? One popular answer is that memory uses
probabilistic mechanisms, and that repeated exposure to an
item increases the probability of its being retrieved later. How
this happens is rarely explained. In any case, it does not seem
to be consistent with the fact that not all learning requires
repetition. If someone tells you that he plans to leave you a
fortune, you will probably remember it for a long time
without his having to repeat it. And faces seen once for a short
time are often recognized long after, even if nothing else is
recalled about the context in which they were first seen,
though not all shapes are so easily remembered. So we do
have some abilities to store things quickly and permanently:
why are they not applied to everything we experience?
<p>
Here is a sketch of a non-probabilistic explanation of the
need for repetition in some cases: the child needs to
experiment with different ways of analysing, describing, and
indexing new experiences. For example, it may be necessary to
experiment with different ways of describing the sounds of
words, so as to develop a good way to cope with variations in
the sound of a word. It may even be necessary to experiment
with ways of analysing a total experience before a particular
sound pattern can be noticed as a significant substructure in
any experience. Many adults have already developed good
ways of indexing information about likely disasters and
benefactions, so that they can store important items and
access them later without repetition.
<p>
A closely related problem is worth mentioning. At any
moment a child's experience is rich and complex. How are
some features selected to be stored? How does the child
decide what is worth learning? More fundamentally, how are
some aspects of the current experience selected as candidates
for things to be recognised if possible? How is a chunk of
sound selected from the whole stream of sounds for an
attempt to find a match among known items? To say that the
child selects what 'interests' her is no explanation, since she
can only decide that something is interesting after it has
already been recognized. (Or at least some parts or aspects of
it have been recognized.) These questions are taken up again
in the chapter on visual perception.
<p>
<h3><b>
<a name="8.7."></a>
<I>
8.7. Knowledge of how to say number words
</I>
</b></h3>
Children learn not merely to recognise familiar words, but
also to say them. How is the ability to say the word
represented in the child's mind? Is it a set of instructions for the
appropriate muscles? Or is there some representation of how
the word sounds, and a general procedure which can examine
a description of a sound sequence and generate appropriate
instructions for muscles? This may be compared with the
difference between compiled and interpreted computer programs.
<p>
Clearly we need some general 'interpretative' procedure in
order to be able to repeat a sequence of sounds which we do
not recognise, for instance when imitating someone talking a
foreign language, where there is no question of simply
repeating something learnt previously.
<p>
Perhaps there are good reasons, if there is no shortage of
space, for storing both explicit instructions for producing the
sound and the specification which allows the sound to be
recognised. But this raises new problems. If the knowledge of
how to say the word is represented differently from
knowledge of what it sounds like, how are the two items related? In
particular, how is the <i>appropriate</i> knowledge found when needed?
<p>
This is just a special case of a much more general problem
about how one piece of information can have other kinds of
information linked to it, or associated with it. Suppose you
have managed to find in your memory something matching a
word you have just heard. How does that help you access
your knowledge of how to reproduce the word yourself?
<p>
<a name="8.8."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
8.8. Storing associations
</I>
</b></h3>
One might think that an answer could take the form: if two
items need to be associated so that when one is found then
the other will be found too, then store them in adjacent
locations in the memory space, just as books on related topics
are often stored in adjacent locations in a library. The trouble
with this is that each stored item may have to be associated
with not just one, but with very many other items, and the
associations can change with time.
<p>
For example, a child has to associate the sound of a
number word not only with how to say it, but also with a method
of writing it down, and a method of reading written versions
of it. She may even learn to say or write it in several different
languages, or several different notations for numerals.
Moreover, as she learns more and more about numbers, she will
have to associate lots more information with each number
name, including: the fact that it is a number name, that it is
a word associated with certain games (e.g. chanting things in
sequence), the fact that its successor is so and so, that its
predecessor is so and so, the fact that it is or it is not a prime
number, the fact that it is odd, or even, its 'multiplication
table', its 'addition table', and so on.
<p>
Of course, not only number names generate this problem.
Many known items each have to be associated with a large
and growing collection of other items. For instance, in your
mind your home town will be linked to very many facts
which you know about the town, such as its name, its
location, its direction and distance (roughly) from major
towns, its population, many of its geographical details, and
so on.
<p>
So we have some new problems. First, if you cannot tell
when you first learn a word, say 'three', how many further
items of information are to be associated with it as a result of
further learning, you cannot tell how much space to reserve
in the neighbourhood of the location at which a description
of the sound is stored. If too little is reserved, you'll find a
limit to what you can learn about the number. But people do
not seem to have such limits. (For instance, think of all the
things associated with the word 'word' in your mind, i.e. all
the words you know.) Is there an upper limit? Some people
can learn several languages!
<p>
Of course, the need for expansion could be dealt with by
moving the whole collection of linked items to a larger
unoccupied space if the initially reserved space overflows. Are
we to assume that children have the ability to manage storage
allocation like this? For instance, do they have ways of telling
which of the 'free' locations have a large enough collection of
free neighbouring locations? Large enough for how many
additional items? Is it possible that extra chunks of space are
allocated in minimal units, as in some computer
storage-allocation procedures? Perhaps people solve the problem by
using an abstract symbolic space of locations, like the space
of decimal numbers: this has the advantage that new
neighbours can always be generated for any given location. But this
merely shifts the problem, for we now have to explain how
information is stored about which symbols occupy which
locations!
<p>
Philosophers love to analyse the concept of rationality,
and to discuss rational ways of doing things. But I have yet
to hear them discuss what it means to have a 'rational' way
of organising and using a massive store of knowledge, subject
to the constraint that in real life decisions often need to be
taken fairly quickly. Attempting to design a working system forces one
to address such issues.
<p>
<a name="8.9."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
8.9. Controlling searches
</I>
</b></h3>
When a recognized item <i>is</i> associated with more than one
other item, and some task requires one of the associated
items, then how is the <i>right</i> one found? If you hear me say
'Please write down the word three', then how do you find the
relevant bit of knowledge associated with the sound 'three'?
That is, how do you find the specifications for writing it as
opposed to saying it, or as opposed to what its successor is,
or whether it is odd or not?
<p>
Obviously this search has to be controlled by the request
or question. For instance, in this case, the hearer has to find
something associated not only with 'three' but also with
'write down'. How is this done? There are many techniques
for this sort of thing which have been explored by computer
programmers, and some of them are quite sophisticated. Do
children have the ability to perform the elaborate operations
used by such programmers, or do they have special techniques
not yet discovered by programmers?
<p>
The problem is compounded by the fact that having learnt
about some structure, we can then learn about a larger whole
containing it as a part. You probably recognise not only the
individual words, but also the whole phrase here: 'three blind
mice'. Which method is used for obeying an instruction like
<blockquote>
<b>
'count to three'?
</b>
</blockquote>
Has the whole instruction been memorised and stored (e.g.
because it is encountered frequently), or is there a process by
which something associated with one of the words (e.g.
'three') is found because it is also associated with one of the
others, or does something much more elaborate than
retrieving a stored specification go on?
<p>
Is it possible that analysis of the instruction is somehow
used to generate an action-specification? Quite likely we can
do both, namely analyse the instruction using general
principles and recognise it as a familiar whole. So how do we, and
children, decide (unconsciously) which to do?
<p>
An explanatory theory, which purports to answer the
questions raised here, must specify some kind of mechanism which
is not merely able to hold learnt information in an efficiently
accessible form, but is also capable of explaining how complex
information structures are built up, how they are modified or
replaced (e.g. when mistakes are discovered), and how they
are used. I do not believe that educational psychologists have
even the foggiest notion of what such a mechanism might be
like, or what its limitations are, or what sorts of teaching
strategies might interfere with its operation or facilitate
learning. Some gifted teachers may have an intuitive grasp of some
aspects of the mechanism, but they probably cannot articulate
their implicit theories.
<p>
Computer scientists dealing with problems of managing
complex collections of information in a flexible way seem to
have unwittingly invented possible explanations some of
which I sketch briefly below.
<p>
If we can find good theories, we may be able to do
something about the large numbers of children who, for one reason
or another, fail to learn so many things which might be useful
or enriching to know. I believe that all normal children have
the potential to learn a great deal of mathematics and other
technical subjects painlessly, if only we knew how to
prevent our teaching methods and attitudes to children (at
home and in schools) from interfering with the learning
process.

A child can learn to answer the question 'What's after three?'
How? The task is not merely to find something associated
with both 'after' and 'three', since the word 'two' may also
be associated with them, for three is after two. The child may
also have learnt that 'five' and 'six' come after 'three' or,
more specifically, that 'five' is two after 'three', 'six' is three
after 'three', and so on.

<b>
Information to be stored about (associated with) "three"
</b>
</center>

<p>
The problem cannot be solved by simply storing some such
symbol as 'four is after three', that is, a representation of the
required fact, since that would not always be the appropriate
answer. For instance the question might be
'In the song <i>Ten green bottles</i> what comes after three?' And if the context is
unambiguous it is not even necessary to mention the song
explicitly in the question.
<p>
So finding the required item of information may involve
analysing the question in such a way as to control the search
for <i>relevant</i> links in memory.
<p>
For example, it may be that each item which is associated
with several others somehow has links to those others which
are labelled as represented in Figure 8.1. It is very easy to draw
diagrams like this, but not so easy to describe mechanisms
which can build and use such structures. A common method
used by programmers is that shown in Figure 8.2.
A 'property-list' or 'association-list' is made up of a
<I>chain of links</I> where
each link contains two storage cells treated as an association
by the memory mechanism, for example because they are
adjacent in the memory space.
<p>
If the items associated with 'three' are all accessible
through a linear list, then fairly obvious search procedures
will enable the wanted item to be found, provided the location
of the initial link of the list can be found easily.

</center>


<p>
A chain of links may be attached to some item, for example the concept
<i>numbers,</i> or the concept <i>three</i> with related items 'hung' from the
chain by means of pointers giving their addresses. As <a href="#fig8.3">Figure
8.3</a> shows, the items hung from the chain may themselves be associations,
corresponding to the labelled links of <a href="#fig8.1">Figure 8.1.</a> Thus in
the context of the chain attached to 'three', there is an association between
'predecessor' and 'two', whereas in a chain attached to 'four' (not shown) there
would be an association between 'predecessor' and 'three'. Associations are
relative to context -- a point that is sometimes forgotten in describing a
learning process as "associative".

<p>
Stored structures are not enough. Procedures are required
for creating and finding associations in them. Such procedures
are easily defined using modern programming languages.
Suppose you want to search down a chain, starting from a
specified link, looking for an association with a specified label
(e.g. 'successor', or 'type'), because you want to find the item
associated with that label in the chain. The obvious way is to
see if the association pair pointed to by the given link starts
with the required label, and if so to treat the second element
of the pair as the desired result. Otherwise start again with
the next link, whose address is in the BACK of the given link.
<p>
In a suitable programming language one could express this as
Procedure-8.1, with the name ASSOC. (I am assuming that the
subroutines FRONT and BACK when applied to a given pair
produce the first thing and the second thing in the pair
respectively. In a list-processing programming language the names of the
mechanisms might be HEAD and TAIL, or HD and TL, or, in Lisp, CAR and CDR.
See Burstall <i>et al. Programming in POP2</i> for
more details. Or the section on list processing in the Pop-11 Primer
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/primer/#sec399">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/primer/#sec399</a>
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>
Procedure ASSOC(LINK, LABEL):
<blockquote>
Given: initial LINK of chain, and target LABEL
<br>
Is FRONT of FRONT of LINK equal to LABEL?
<br>
If so, result is BACK of FRONT of LINK. STOP.
<br>
Otherwise, assign BACK of LINK to LINK, and restart,
with LABEL as target.
<blockquote>
<I>Procedure-8.1</I>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
So ASSOC('THREE', 'TYPE') could represent the
application of this procedure to a memory structure like Figure 8.3,
with LINK starting as the first link in the chain called
THREE', and LABEL having TYPE' as its value. The
procedure would find a pointer to 'number' as its result.
<p>
Similarly ASSOC('THREE', 'SUCCESSOR') would find
the successor of 'three', namely 'four'. The same thing could
then be used to find the successor of 'four', if that had been
stored appropriately. By interleaving such searches with
actions of saying what has been found, the child would have
a procedure for counting, that is for reciting the numbers in
their appropriate order. (More on the problems of interleaving
later.)
<p>
Another way of thinking about this, is to say that
information stored in a collection of structures like Figure 8.3, one
for each known numeral, can be thought of as a sort of
program for doing various things. The structure shown in Figure
8.2 is a much simpler program, and there is less that can be
done with it. However using it as a program for counting is a
simpler matter than using a collection of structures like Figure
8.3, since in Figure 8.2 all you need do in order to decide what to
say next is find the link pointed to by the BACK of the
current link in the chain (whose FRONT is a number or numeral),
whereas in Figure 8.3 you first have to
search for the 'successor' label, and then take the link it
points to, and then start again from that link. We shall see
later that different sorts of chains can coexist and be used for
different purposes. (Figure 8.6)
<p>
Of course, there are many more structures and procedures
that might be used for storing information about linear
sequences in a computer, or in a mind. Different methods
have their own advantages and disadvantages. For instance,
the method of Figure 8.2, though simple and quick to use, has
the disadvantage that when you get to the link involving
'three', there is no information stored there about items
coming earlier in the chain. So using that structure makes it
harder to answer questions like 'what comes before three?',
though easier to answer questions like 'what comes after
three?'
<p>
This is a space-time 'trade-off. Other trade-offs involved in selecting
representations include efficiency vs flexibility, simplicity of structures vs
simplicity of procedures, and so on. Chapter 7 discussed trade-offs between
Fregean and analogical representations. Investigations of such trade-offs
between different representations are central to artificial intelligence but
have hitherto been absent from philosophical discussions of rationality and most
psychological theorising about cognitive processes.
<p>
Proposed explanations of a child's counting abilities must
do much more than explain how the child manages to recite
known numbers, or how the child answers simple questions.
For example, it is necessary to explain also how the
representation gets built up in the first place, how new items are
added, and how mistakes are corrected. One may miss out an
element of the sequence, or store some elements in the wrong
order. So procedures are required for inserting new links, for
deleting old ones, and perhaps for changing the order of
existing links, when mistakes are discovered.
<p>
A more complex procedure is required for adding a new
association: it will have to get a free link (how?) and insert it
at a suitable place in the chain, with its FRONT pointing to
the new association and its BACK pointing to the next link in
the chain, if any.
<p>
If children do anything like this to store and use
associations, then how do they build up such chains, and how do
they come to know the procedures for finding required
associations? Perhaps the ability to learn and use chains of
associations, employing procedures something like ASSOC, is
inborn? Clearly not all procedures for getting at stored
information are innate. For instance, children have to <i>learn</i>
how to count backwards or answer 'What's before "four"?'
even though they may already know the order of the
numbers. The same applies to other sequences children learn.
(More about such tasks later.)

<h3><b>
<I>
8.11. Control-structures for counting-games
</I>
</b></h3>
All this points to the old idea (compare Miller <i>et al.,</i> 1960)
that human abilities have much in common with computer
programs. But further reflection on familiar facts shows that
programs in the most common programming languages do
not provide a rich enough basis for turning this from a thin
metaphor into an explanatory theory.
<p>
For instance, people can execute unrelated actions in
parallel, like walking and talking. Moreover, they apparently
do not require their procedures to have <i>built-in</i> tests to ensure
that conditions for their operation continue to be satisfied.
Nor do they require explicit instructions about what to do
otherwise, like instructions in a computer program for dealing
with the end of a list. All sorts of unpredictable things can
halt a human action at any stage (like learning one's house is
on fire) and a decision about what to do can be taken when
the interruption occurs, even if no explicit provision for such
a possibility is built into the plan or procedure being executed.
<p>
These points suggest that models of human competence
will have to use mechanisms similar to operating systems for
multi-programmed computers. For instance, an operating
system can run a program, then interrupt it when some event
occurs although the program itself makes no provision for
interruption. Similarly, if something goes wrong with the
running of the program, like an attempt to go beyond the end of
a list, the program breaks down, but the operating system or
interpreter running the program can decide what to do, (for
example, send a message to the programmer), so that there is
not a total breakdown. Of course the operating system is just
another program.
<p>
So the point is simply that to make the program metaphor
fit human abilities we must allow not merely that one
program can use another as a 'subroutine' but that some
programs can execute others and control their execution, in a
parallel rather than a hierarchic fashion. (For more on this,
see chapters 6, 9 and 10.)

<h3><b>
<I>
8.12. Problems of co-ordination
</I>
</b></h3>
In counting objects, a child has to be able to generate
different action sequences in parallel, keeping them in phase. Thus
the process of saying number names, controlled by an internal
structure, and the process of pointing in turn at objects in
some group, the latter process being controlled by the external
structure, have to be kept in phase. In a suitable programming
language one could keep two processes in phase by means of
a procedure something like the procedure COEXECUTE
<p>

<blockquote>
<b>
Procedure COEXECUTE(P1, P2):
<blockquote>
Given: step-by-step procedures P1 and P2,
<br>
Execute a step of P1.
<br>
Execute a step of P2.
<br>
Has a stopping condition been reached?
<br>
If not, restart COEXECUTE (P1, P2).
<blockquote>
<I>Procedure-8.2</I>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
Unfortunately, this is not an acceptable model in view of
the familiar fact that children (and adults doing things in
parallel) sometimes get out of phase when counting and
(sometimes) stop and correct themselves. This suggests that keeping
the two sequences in phase is done by a third process
something like an operating system which starts the processes at
specified speeds, but monitors their performance and modifies
the speeds if necessary, interrupting and perhaps restarting if
the sequences get out of phase. All this would be impossible
with the procedure COEXECUTE. It is as if we could write
programs something like the procedure RUNINSTEP.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>
Procedure RUNINSTEP(P1, P2):
<blockquote>
Given: procedures P1 and P2,
<br>
DO (a) to (d) in parallel:
<br>
(a) repeatedly do P1
<br>
(b) repeatedly do P2
<br>
(c) observe whether (a) and (b) are getting out of step
and, if they are, slow one down or speed up the other.
<br>
(d) if (a) and (b) are right out of step re-start P1 and P2
<blockquote>
<i>Procedure-8.3</i>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
The computational facilities required for this kind of thing
are much more sophisticated than in COEXECUTE and are
not provided in familiar programming languages.
<p>

<blockquote>
<b>[[Note added January 2002</b>
<br>
The ability to monitor and modify two concurrently executed processes
requires an information processing <I>architecture</I> which is not
supported by the virtual machines defined by most programming languages,
though it is a feature of operating systems. This is one of the sorts of
task that might be required in a "meta-management" system, described
briefly here:
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/vm-functionalism.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/vm-functionalism.html</a>
<b>]]</b>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice also
that there is a complex perceptual task involved in deciding
whether two processes are getting out of step, and children
sometimes find this difficult. Not only children: try counting
rotations of a wheel with no clear markings on it, while it is
turning quite rapidly!
<p>
Further, the child has to be able to apply different stopping
conditions for this complex parallel process, depending on
what the task is. So it should be possible for yet another
process to run the procedure RUNINSTEP, watching out for
appropriate stopping conditions. Alternatively, the procedure
could be re-defined so as to have an additional 'given', namely
a stopping condition, and an extra sub-process, (e), watching
out for it.
<p>
For instance, when the question is 'How many
buttons are there?' use 'No more buttons' as main stopping
condition, whereas in response to a request 'Give me five
buttons', use 'Number five reached' as main stopping condition.
<p>
I say <i>main</i> stopping condition, because other conditions
may force a halt, such as getting out of phase or running out
of numbers or (in the second case) running out of buttons.
<p>
How do children learn to apply the same process with
different stopping conditions for different purposes?
<p>
How is the intended stopping condition plugged into the process?
<p>
Notice
that the perceptual tasks are further complicated by the need
to detect different sorts of conditions, for example,
completion of the task, getting out of phase, running out of things
to count, mistakes like counting the same thing twice, or
leaving something out, and so on.
<p>
Some of this would be easy for a programmer using a
high-level language in which a procedure (to test for the stopping
condition) can be given as input to another procedure  but
do children have such facilities, or do they use mechanisms
more like the parallel processes with interrupt facilities
described here?
<p>
I believe we know very little about how children achieve
these extraordinarily complex feats. Nor do we understand
what sorts of teaching strategies can help or hinder their
development. My own informal observations suggest that a
tremendous amount of very varied practice is required, in an
environment where teachers can use a deep analysis of failures
to suggest variations in games and other learning activities.
This analysis can be a challenging intellectual task. How many
teachers are equipped for it?
<p>
The parallel mechanisms suggested above might explain the
ability to learn to watch out for new kinds of errors. For
example, after learning to count stairs, where there is little
chance of counting an item twice, learning to count buttons
or dots requires learning to monitor for repetition and
omission.
<p>
Depending on the kind(s) of programming language(s) and
operating system(s) used in a child's mind, it may be easier to
add a new kind of monitoring process to run in parallel with
previously learnt processes than to re-organise an existing
procedure so as to include new tests at appropriate places, as
would be required with a conventional programming language.
Probably both sorts of learning occur.
<p>
Monitoring interactions between asynchronous parallel
processes may be an important source of accidental discoveries
(creativity) in children and adults. For example, ongoing
(unconscious) comparisons between intermediate results of two
different activities may lead one to notice a relation between
the two which amounts to a new technique, concept, or
theory -- yet another example of use of serendipity.
<p>
This whole discussion is centrally relevant to the
analysis of concepts like consciousness, attention, and
intention.
<p>
We now have a basis for a complete rejection of a major
theme of Ryle's pioneering work <i>The Concept of Mind,</i>
namely its refusal to accept multiple inner mental processes.
<p>
We also have a basis for beginning to explore personality
differences and mental disorders relating to problems of
organising and controlling several different processes. By trying to
design systems involving multiple interacting processes we
gain a deeper understanding of the problems and possibilities.

<h3><b>
<I>
8.13. Interleaving two sequences
</I>
</b></h3>
If we consider what happens when a child learns to count
beyond twenty, we find that a different kind of co-ordination
between two sequences is required, namely the sequence 'one,
two, three . . . nine' and the sequence 'twenty, thirty, . . .
ninety'. Each time one gets round to 'nine' in the first
sequence one has to find one's place in the second sequence
so as to locate the next item. The same is true of counting
backwards from a large number. (The rules in different
languages are slightly different, but the general principles are
apparently the same in most.)
<p>
A programmer would find this trivial, but how does a child
create this kind of interleaving in his mind? And why is there
sometimes difficulty over keeping track of position in the
second sequence '... fifty-eight, fifty-nine, . . . um . . . er,
thirty, thirty-one . . . '? Clearly this is not a problem unique
to children. We all have trouble at times with this sort of
book-keeping. But how is it done when successful? And what
kind of mechanism could be successful sometimes yet
unsuccessful at others?
<p>
My guess is that human fallibility has nothing to do with
differences between brains and computers as is often supposed,
but is a direct consequence of the sheer complexity and
flexibility of human abilities and knowledge, so that for example
there are always too many plausible but false trails to follow.
When computers are programmed to know so much they will
be just as fallible, and they will have to improve themselves
by the same painful and playful processes we use.
<p>
<a name="8.14."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
8.14. Programs as examinable structures
</I>
</b></h3>
We have noted a number of familiar aspects of counting and
other actions which suggest that compiled programs in
commonly used programming languages do not provide a good
model for human abilities. A further point to notice is that
we not only <i>execute</i> our procedures or programs, we also
<i>build them up</i> in a piecemeal fashion (as in learning to
count),
<i>modify</i> them when they seem inadequate, and <i>examine</i> them
in order to anticipate their effects without execution. We can
decide that old procedures may be relevant to new problems,
we can select subsections for use in isolation from the rest,
and we may even learn to run them backwards (like learning
to count backwards).
<p>
This requires that besides having names and sets of
instructions, procedures need to be associated with specifications of
what they are for, the conditions under which they work,
information about likely side-effects, etc. The child must
build up a <i>catalogue</i> of his own resources. This is already
done in some A.I. programs, e.g. Sussman, 1975.
<p>
Further, the instructions need to be stored in a form which
is accessible not only for execution but also for analysis and
modification, like inserting new steps, deleting old ones, or
perhaps modifying the order of the steps, as is done in
Sussman's program. Such examination and editing cannot
be done to programs as they are usually stored, after
compilation.
<p>
List structures in which the order of instructions is
represented by labelled links rather than implicitly by position
in memory would provide a form of representation meeting
some of these requirements (and are already used in some
programming languages). Thus, as already remarked, Figure 8.2
can be thought of either as a structure storing information
about number names (an analogical representation of their
order), or else as a program for counting. The distinction
between data structures and programs has to be rejected in a
system which can treat program steps as objects which are
related to one another and can be changed. We now explore
some consequences of this using counting as an example.
<p>
<a name="8.15."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
8.15. Learning to treat numbers as objects with relationships
</I>
</b></h3>
There are several ways in which understanding of a familiar
action sequence may be deficient, and may improve. One may
know a sequence very well, like a poem, telephone number,
the spelling of a word, or the alphabet, yet have trouble
reciting it backwards. One may find it hard to start from an
arbitrary position in a sequence one knows well, like saying
what comes after 'K' in the alphabet, or starting a piano piece
in the middle. But performance on these tasks can improve.
<p>
A child who counts very well may be unable easily to
answer 'What comes after five?'. Later, he may be able to
answer that question, but fail on 'What comes before six?',
'Does eight come earlier or later than five?' and 'Is three
between five and eight?'. He does not know his way about the
number sequence in his head, though he knows the sequence.
<p>
Further, he may understand the questions well enough to
answer when the numbers have been written down before
him, or can be seen on a clock. (There are problems about
how this ability to use what you see to answer such questions is
learnt, but I shall not go into them.)
<p>
Later, the child may learn to answer such questions in his
head, and even to count backwards quickly from any position
in the sequence he has memorised. How? To say the child
'internalises' his external actions (an answer I have often been
given in the past) is merely to label the problem, if all that is
intended is the claim that one can learn to represent in one's mind
actions previously performed externally.
<p>
Moving back and forth along a chain of stored associations is quite a
different matter from moving up and down staircases or moving one's own
eye or finger back and forth along a row of objects. The latter is a
physical movement through space, whereas the former is movement through
a set of computational states, not necessarily involving physical
movement. Lack of reversibility in one case may be accounted
for by physical structures, like ratchets or uni-directional
motors, whereas in the other case the explanation is more
likely to be lack of information. For instance in Figure 2, the
link pointing to 'four' contains information about the next
link, but does not contain information about the preceding
link.
<p>
Learning to overcome physical impediments to reversibility
need have nothing in common with learning to overcome
computational problems. The child who has learned to move
his eye or finger back and forth around a clock face to answer
'what comes before four' is not thereby provided with a
mechanism which could somehow be used internally. At most, it
provides him with a model, or analogy, which may be helpful
in grasping what the task is. But how the analogy is used is
totally unexplained.
<p>
<a name="8.16."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
8.16. Two major kinds of learning
</I>
</b></h3>
There are at least two important kinds of development of
knowledge about a previously stored structure (which may be
a program), namely
<ol Type="a">
<li>learning new procedures for doing things with the
structure
<li>extending the structure so as to contain more explicit
information about itself.
</ol>
The former will tend to be involved in learning to do new
kinds of things with the stored information, whereas the latter
may simply be a matter of improving the efficiency with
which old tasks are performed. But this in turn may facilitate
the learning of quite new tasks which depend on rapid and
skilful execution of sub-tasks using previous skills. (This bears
on the debate about formal and informal methods of teaching
in schools.)
<p>
A very simple procedure enables a chain like that in Figure
8.2 to be used to generate a sequence of actions, for example
the procedure RECITE.
<blockquote>
<b>
Procedure RECITE(LINK)
<blockquote>
Given a chain starting from LINK.
<br>
Utter FRONT of LINK.
<br>
If BACK of LINK isn't empty, make it LINK and restart.
<br>
Otherwise stop.
<blockquote>
<i>Procedure-8.4</i>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
Going down the chain starting from a given link is thus easy,
and a procedure to find the successor of an item would use a
similar principle. But answering 'What's before item X?' is
more sophisticated, since on getting to a particular location
(e.g. the link whose FRONT points to X), one does not find
there any information about how one got there. Somehow
the last item found must be stored temporarily. One method
is illustrated in the procedure PREDECESSOR, as it might be
defined in a programming language.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>
Procedure PREDECESSOR(X, LINK):
<blockquote>
Given target X in chain starting at LINK:
<br>
Create temporary store TEMP, with undefined value.
<br>
Repeat the following:
<blockquote>
If FRONT of LINK = X then result is TEMP, stop.
<br>
Otherwise, assign FRONT of LINK to TEMP and
BACK of LINK to LINK and restart.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<i>Procedure-8.5</i>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
How could a child learn to create a procedure like this?
Does he start with something more specialised,
then somehow
design a general method which will work on arbitrary chains?
Perhaps it has something to do with manipulating rows of
objects and other sequences outside one's head, but to say
this does not give an explanation, since we do not know what
mechanisms enable children to cope with external sequences,
and in any case, as already remarked, chains of associations
have quite different properties. For a child to see the analogy
would require very powerful abilities to do abstract reasoning.
Maybe the child needs them anyway, in order to learn
anything.
<p>
My observations suggest that the child's learning task (at least
between the ages of three and four, or later) is very different from
the
task of designing a procedure like Procedure-8.4. This is because the
child is already able to remember steps he has just executed. So if
he is asked to count to 'four' and does so, and then is immediately
asked what came before 'four' he can answer. He does not have to
allocate special-purpose temporary storage, like the 'local variable'
TEMP. His problem is <i>to think of counting up to four</i> as a way of
answering the question 'What comes before four?'
<p>
He does not, presumably, have a representation of the fact that if he recites
some sequence he can remember the final fragment immediately after stopping.
Adults have learnt this and can use it to answer a question about the
predecessor of a letter of the alphabet, even if they do not have the
information explicitly stored. However this technique is very tedious for
reciting the whole of a learnt sequence backwards, and is useless if the process
is to be done quickly. (The general ability to remember what one has just done
is useful for the reasons given in <a href="#list-chap6">Chapter 6.</a> The
reasons apply to intelligent artefacts as well as to humans. This
self-monitoring is not usually a built-in feature of programming systems, but
there is no difficulty of principle in incorporating it.)

<h3><b>
<I>
8.17. Making a reverse chain explicit
</I>
</b></h3>
Merely being able to invent some procedure for finding the
predecessor of a number is not good enough. For some
purposes, such as counting backwards quickly, we want to be
able to find the predecessor or successor of an item much
more quickly than by searching down the chain of links until
the item is found.
<p>

<a name="fig8.4"></a>

<b>
Two co-existing
chains record different orders for the same set of items.
</b>
</center>
<p>
If a child knew only the first four numbers, then he could
memorise them in both directions, building up the structure
of Figure 8.4 instead of Figure 8.2. Notice that this use of two
chains increases the complexity of tasks like 'Say the
numbers', or 'What's after three?', since the right chain has to be
found, while reducing the complexity of tasks like 'Say the
numbers backwards' and 'What's before three?'. (Another
example of a computational trade-off.)
<p>
However, when a longer sequence had been learnt, this
method would still leave the need to search down one or
other chain to find the number N in order to respond to
'What's after N?', 'What's before N?', 'Count from N', 'Count
backwards from N', 'Which numbers are between N and M?',
etc., for there is only one route into each chain, leading to
the beginning of the chain. For instance, when one has found
the link labelled 'X' in Figure 8.4, one knows how to get to the
stored representation of 'three'. But it is not possible simply
to start from the representation of 'three' to get to the links
which point to it in the two chains. So we need to be able to
associate with 'three' itself information about where it is in
the sequence, what its predecessor is, what its successor is,
and so on.

</center>

<hr>
<p>
A step in this direction is shown in <a href="#fig8.5">Figure 8.5</a>, where each
number name is associated with a link which contains
addresses of both the predecessor and the successor, like the
link marked V, associated with 'two'. The information that
the predecessor is found in the FRONT and the successor
found in the BACK would be implicit in procedures used for
answering questions about successors and predecessors.
However, if one needed to associate much more information with
each item, and did not want to be committed to having the
associations permanently in a particular order, then it would
be necessary to label them explicitly, using structures like
those in <a href="#fig8.1">Figure 8.1</a>, and <a href="#fig8.3">Figure 8.3</a>,
accessed by a general procedure like ASSOC, defined previously.
<p>

To cut a long story short, the result of explicitly storing lots of discoveries
about each number, might be something like the network of associations in
<a href="#fig8.6">Figure 8.6</a>,
which is highly redundant, in the sense that a
lot of the information there could in principle be derived from other
information in the network.  On the left there are (vertical) chains of links
available for use in counting rapidly forwards or backwards, analogous to the
chains in Figures <a href="#fig8.2">8.2</a> and <a href="#fig8.4">8.4</a>.
In addition, associated with each number is a
great deal of information about it in a chain of attribute/value pairs analogous
to <a href="#fig8.3">Figure 8.3</a>,
except that some of the values are new sub-chains. Included in the
chain hanging from each number is a pointer into the 'fast-forward' chain and a
pointer into the 'fastback' chain, making it possible to count quickly forwards
or backwards from that number without first having to search for the number in
the relevant 'fast' chain.

<p>
In the light of the previous remarks about the need to blur the distinction
between information-structures and programs, we can see how a structure like
that depicted in <a href="#fig8.6">Figure 8.6</a> can be thought of as
containing several different programs embedded within it, such as programs for
counting forward from various numbers, programs for counting backwards from
various numbers, programs for answering questions, and so on. The different
programs share common sub-structures.
<p>
The growth of this kind of network would be an example
of the second type of learning, namely extending an
information store to contain explicitly what was previously
implicit in it. This often involves trading space for time. That
is, much redundant information is stored explicitly so that it
does not have to be re-computed every time it is needed. This
includes information on how to do things. It seems that a
great deal of early learning about numbers has this character, as well
as much of the development of skill an fluency in thinking and acting.
<p>
"Progressive" educational procedures which attempt to do without any
rote learning may be depriving children (or adult learners!) of
opportunities to build up some structures which are useful for rapid
access -- unless the old formal methods are replaced with carefully
structured play situations, to achieve the same effect (which they could
probably do much more effectively, since they would be more highly
motivating.) Children need a lot of practice at 'finding their way
about' their own data-structures.
<p>
The structure of <a href="#fig8.6">Figure 8.6</a> may look very complex, yet
using it to answer certain questions requires simpler procedures than using, say
<a href="#fig8.2">Figure 8.2</a>. For, having found the link representing a
number, one can then find information associated with that number by simply
following forward pointers from it, for example, using a procedure like ASSOC;
whereas in <a href="#fig8.2">Figure 8.2</a> or <a href="#fig8.5">Figure 8.5</a>,
finding the predecessor and successor of a number requires using two different
procedures, and each requires a search down a chain of all the numbers to start
with. Of course, a structure like <a href="#fig8.6">Figure 8.6</a> provides
simple and speedy access at the cost of using up much more storage space. But in
the human mind space does not seem to be in short supply!
<p>
<a href="#fig8.6">Figure 8.6</a>, below indicates how chains of associations
can be used to represent some of what a child must learn about numbers.
Double boxes are used to indicate parts of the network directly
accessible from a central index of names.

Figure 8.6
</b></h3>

</center>

<p>
A further problem is that each time new information is added to a chain, the
increased length increases the average time for searching along the chain. So if
an item in a structure like <a href="#fig8.6">Figure 8.6</a> has a very long
chain of associations, it might be preferable to replace the linear chain with a
local index to avoid long searches. So, instead of 'three' being linked to a
linear list of associations, it would have some kind of structured catalogue.
Someone who knew a very large number of things about 'three' might find that
this saved time searching for information. This would require the procedure
ASSOC to be replaced by something more sophisticated, and would probably also
require more space. Alternatively, by switching pointers, one could easily bring
a link to the front of the chain each time the association hanging from it is
used: this would ensure that most recently and most frequently used information
was found first, without the help of probabilistic mechanisms, often postulated
to explain such phenomena.
<p>
<a name="8.18."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
8.18. Some properties of structures containing pointers
</I>
</b></h3>
Notice that in a structure like <a href="#fig8.6">Figure 8.6</a>, normal 'part-whole'
constraints are violated: information about numbers is part
of information about 'three', and <i>vice versa.</i> So by using
pointers (addresses) we can allow structures to share each
other. In a rich conceptual system circular definitions will
abound. If much of our knowledge is non-hierarchic, as this
suggests, then perhaps strictly cumulative educational
procedures designed to achieve complete clarity at every stage
are quite misguided. So also are philosophical investigations
of knowledge in the tradition of Descartes, trying to show
how everything can be based on completely rational chains of
inference starting from self-evident, or at least minimally
doubtful, premisses.
<p>
(Perhaps only trivial things can be taught without generating a great
deal of confusion. Infants learning to speak experience a great deal
of confusion, but this does not usually make them give up! Only
later on do we teach them to give up too soon, by labelling them as
'stupid', for example, or perhaps by helping them too often when
they are in difficulty.<a href="#chap8-note1" name="chap8-ref1">[8.1]</a>)'
<p>
This kind of circularity (or mutual recursion) is especially
common in our mental concepts. For instance, the concept
of 'belief cannot be analysed without reference to the
concepts of desire and decision, and these cannot be analysed
without reference to each other and the concept of belief.
Yet ordinary people learn to use these concepts in their
ordinary life (for instance, when they explain someone's action
in terms of a belief: 'He did it because he believed I was out
to get him'). We learn to use mutually recursive concepts
without being at all aware of their complexity.
<p>
In my experience philosophers and psychologists tend to get very
confused about how to deal with this kind of circularity, for
example in discussing varieties of Behaviourism. Analogies with
recursive computer programs and data-structures can help to clarify
the issue. One can distinguish varieties of behaviourism according to
whether they will tolerate recursion (especially mutual recursion) in
their definitions of mental concepts. Ryle's book <i>The Concept of Mind</i> was more sophisticated in this respect than most other forms
of behaviourism, since it implicitly allowed mutually recursive
definitions of mental concepts, implying that mentalistic concepts
cannot all be eliminated by analysis in terms of dispositions to
respond to stimuli. This, presumably, explains why Ryle did not see
himself as a behaviourist.
<p>
The kind of structure depicted in <a href="#fig8.6">Figure 8.6</a>
does not
need a separate index or catalogue specifying where to look
for associations involving known items, for it acts as an index
to itself, provided there are some ways of getting quickly
from outside the structure to key nodes, like the cells
containing 'three' and 'number'. (This might use an index, or
content addressable store, or indexing tricks analogous to
hash coding, for speedy access.)
<p>
The use of structures built up from linked cells and
pointers like this has a number of additional interesting
features, only a few of which can be mentioned here. Items
can be added, deleted, or rearranged merely by changing a
few addresses, without any need for advance reservation of
large blocks of memory or massive shuffling around of
information, as would be required if items were stored in blocks
of adjacent locations (another trade-off: space against
flexibility).
<p>
The same items can occur in different orders in different structures which share
information (see <a href="#fig8.4">Figure 8.4</a> for a simple example).
Moreover, the order can be changed in one
sequence without affecting another which shares structure
with it. For instance, in Figure 8.4 the addresses in links W, X,
Y, and Z can be changed so as to alter the order of numbers
in chain labelled 'reverse' without altering the chain labelled
'forward'.
<p>
As we saw in connection with <a href="#fig8.2">Figure 8.2</a>, when the rest of
the mechanism is taken for granted, a structure of the kind discussed here looks
like a program for generating behaviour, but when one looks into problems of how
a structure gets assembled and modified, how parts are accessed, how the
different stopping conditions are applied, etc., then it looks more like an
information structure used by other programs.

<a name="8.19."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
8.19. Conclusion
</I>
</b></h3>
Further reflection on facts we all know reveals many gaps in the kinds of
mechanisms described here. For instance, very little has been said about the
<i>procedures</i> required for building, checking, modifying, and using a
structure like <a href="#fig8.6">Figure 8.6</a>. Nothing has been said about the
problems of perception and conception connected with the fact that counting is
not applied simply to bits of the world but bits of the world individuated
according to a concept (one family, five people, millions of cells  but the same
bit of the world counted in different ways).
<p>
I have offered no explanation of the ability to answer
'How many?' questions by recognising a visual pattern,
without explicit counting. Obviously, there is a lot to be said
about the development of new perceptual abilities related to
numbers, for example the ability to perceive groups of three
objects without counting, by matching against a structural
definition, much as one recognises arches, letters and horses
(see <a href="#chap9">Chapter 9</a> and Winston, 1975).
<p>
Nothing has been said about how the child discovers general and non-contingent
facts about counting (or why they fail to discover them, for several years, as
reported in <a href="#piaget-number">Piaget [1952]</a>), such as the fact that
the order in which objects are counted does not matter, rearranging the objects
does not matter, the addition or removal or an object must change the result of
counting, and so on
(see <a href="#note-ch-8-20160217">notes added Feb 2016</a>).
How does a child come to grasp the fact that in principle
counting can go on indefinitely, so that its stock of number names may need to
be extended, or replaced by a rule with unlimited generative power?
<p>
(Philosophers' discussions of such non-empirical learning are usually so vague
and abstract as to beg most of the questions. Piagetian psychologists comment on
some of the achievements, but provide no means of analysing or explaining the
underlying mental processes discussed here.)
<p>
I cannot explain these and many more things that even
primary school children learn. I do not believe that anybody
has even the beginnings of explanations for most of the things
we know they can (sometimes) do: all we find is new jargon
for labelling the phenomena.
<p>
I have offered all this only as a tiny sample of the kind of
exploration needed for developing our abilities to build
theoretical models worth taking seriously. In the process our
concept of mechanism will be extended and the superficiality of
current problems, theories and experiments in psychology
and educational technology will become apparent.
<p>
Philosophers have much to learn from this sort of exercise
too, concerning old debates about the nature of mind, the
nature of concepts and knowledge, varieties of inference, etc.
Consider my short survey of answers they have given to the
question 'What are numbers?' The answers do not begin to
match the complexity of what a child has to grasp in learning
about numbers. They do not account for the fact that
number concepts are used in a variety of activities. They perhaps
take the uses for granted, but make no attempt to explain
how they are possible. Philosophers of the future, who have
a much better grasp of what such explanations might look
like, will be in a better position to formulate adequate
analyses.
<p>
Similarly, when they have learnt about possible
mechanisms underlying processes of inference and discovery, they
will be in a better position to discuss the nature of
mathematical discovery and other forms of a <i>priori</i> learning.
The most
that can be said at present is that it will probably prove
helpful to think of mathematical discovery by analogy with a
program which discovers new facts about itself by a
combination of executing parts of itself and examining some of
its instructions. In the process it might decide that some
things could be done more quickly in a different way. Or it
might discover, by analysing its own structure, that instead of
executing bits of programs, it can work out their effects by
reasoning about them.
<p>
More importantly, it may discover ways of generalising and
extending its procedures to accomplish more tasks of the
same sort, or new kinds of tasks. Programmers often discover
unexpected ways of elaborating and generalising their
programs, in the course of examining and using them, much as
an artist learns more about what he can and should do by
examining an incomplete work. A program which builds its
own programs can do this too. Sussman's 'Hacker' program
(1975) builds programs, and, in some cases, generalises them.
<p>
I believe that similar ideas are to be found in Piaget's
writings. Computer models turn such thoughts from vague
speculations to testable theories. See Young, 1976, for an example.
<p>
These sorts of second-order discoveries about one's own procedures
do not fit the normal definition of 'empirical'. For example, they need
not involve the use of
the senses to gain information about the world. And a kind of necessity
seems  to  be  involved  in the  truths  so  discovered
which is not normally thought to be compatible with empirical
learning: if experience can lead us to a hypothesis can it
not also produce a refutation of the hypothesis?
<p>
But it seems
that no experience can refute the claim that adding two lots
of two things produces the same result as adding one thing to
a group of three things, or the claim that there is no largest
number. And the same is true of many other discoveries
about properties of the procedures we use. Yet such
mathematical discoveries involve a kind of exploration of
possibilities which is closely analogous to empirical
learning.<a href="#chap8-note2" name="chap8-ref2">[8.2]</a>
<p>
We need a richer set of distinctions than philosophers
normally employ. There is learning from sensory experience and
learning from symbolic experience. The latter seems to
include the processes generating what Kant called 'synthetic
<I>a priori</I> knowledge'. However these processes require a great
deal of further investigation. In particular, it is important to
note that symbolic experiences may occur either entirely
within the mind, or else may use external symbolisms, as
when we use diagrams or calculations on paper. The use of
our senses to examine our symbols and our procedures for
manipulating them should not be confused with the use of our senses to
examine the behaviour of objects in the world.
<p>
The task of designing programs which simulate these sorts
of human learning to a significant extent is at the frontiers of
current research in artificial intelligence. Until further
progress has been made, philosophical speculation about
non-empirical knowledge is likely to remain as unproductive as it
has been through most of history.
<p>
The old nature-nurture (heredity-environment) controversy
is transformed by this sort of enquiry. The abilities required
in order to make possible the kind of learning described here,
for instance the ability to construct and manipulate stored
symbols, build complex networks, use them to solve
problems, analyse them to discover errors, modify them, etc.,
all these abilities are more complex and impressive than what
is actually learnt about numbers! Where do these abilities
come from? Could they conceivably be learnt during infancy
without presupposing equally powerful symbolic abilities to
make the learning possible? Maybe the much discussed ability
to learn the grammar of natural languages (cf. Chomsky,
1965) is simply a special application of this more general
ability? This question cannot be discussed usefully in our
present ignorance about possible learning mechanisms.
<p>
Finally a question for educationalists. What would be the
impact on primary schools if intending teachers were exposed
to these problems and given some experience of trying to
build and use models like Figure 6 on a computer? Our
experience of teaching philosophy and psychology students
computing in the Cognitive Studies Programme at Sussex
University, and similar experiences at other centres, such as
Edinburgh University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
suggests that it can produce a major transformation of
outlook  including a new respect for the achievements of
children. Here is a tremendous opportunity for educational
administrators and teacher-training institutions. Will they
grasp it?<a href="#chap8-note3" name="chap8-ref3">[*]</a>

between human nipples and the rubber variety, infants who are
breast-fed develop a better grasp of some basic principles of physics
and
mechanics at a very early age  because they have to surmount more

<b>Notes added 17 Feb 2016: What needs to be explained</b>
<br>
The original version of this chapter did not make the following assumptions
about number competences clear enough for readers unfamiliar with analyses of
cardinal number concepts by Frege, Russell, Piaget and others, and who lacked
practical AI/software engineering experience.
<p>
<div style="margin-left:20px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">
<b>o</b>
Learning about the natural numbers is dependent on a prior ability to set up
(possibly transient) one-to-one (1-1) correspondences between two discrete sets
of entities, which may be concrete (i.e. physical) or abstract, co-existing, or
existing at different times, or events occurring over time, such as sequential
utterances of number names. (As remarked earlier, Piaget understood this.)
<p>
<b>o</b> The entities thus related need not be of the same kind: e.g. a 1-1
correspondence can be set up between a collection of physical objects and an
abstract collection of names, or between a collection of people and a set of
objects they need, e.g. people and chairs, people and places at a dinner table,
or between a spatial configuration (steps on a staircase) and a temporal
sequence (e.g. a sequential process of putting a foot on a step), or between
botanical species and musical compositions, etc., etc.
<p>
<b>o</b> The entities involved in such a correspondence can include arbitrary
ordered items, such as learnt collections of spoken names (e.g. the sounds
"one", "five", "thirteen"), or learnt collections of spatial symbols (e.g. the
printed symbols "one", "1", "99", "a", "B", etc.) or temporally or spatially
ordered collections, e.g. a remembered row of statues, or a remembered sequence
of events.
<br>
(See <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic</a>)
<p>
<b>o</b> A fixed list of memorised spoken or written names could be used for counting
small sets, but in order to understand number concepts fully one must realise
that any fixed finite list would not be adequate for counting sets
of objects with more components than there are learnt number names.
<p>
<b>o</b> The need for an unbounded set of number names can be met by using
systematically generated numerical labels, with a principle of generation that
is inherently unbounded. There are many ways of making a collection of names
indefinitely extendable, including the use of repeated signs (X, XX, XXX, XXXX,
XXXXX,... etc) use of familiar decimal and binary number notations or Roman
numerals, and use of verbal rules for generating new names, which differ between
human languages.
<br>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Large_numbers">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Large_numbers</a>)
<p>
<b>o</b>
The system used may or may not cope with empty collections. We now take it for
granted that an item before "1" occurs in the natural number series, namely "0",
which can be a possible answer to "How many?" questions, e.g. "How many people
are left in the room?". However "0" is not normally used for counting, except in
connection with locations in a computer memory, or, in some programming
languages, locations in abstract linear structures.
<br>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_%28number%29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_%28number%29</a>)
<p>
<b>o</b> The elements of a set of items in a 1-1 correspondence with another set do not
need to be in close proximity, and need not exist at the same time: e.g. they
could be towns on different continents, events in different centuries, etc. Thus
it makes sense to ask whether Julius Caesar ate more meals than there are cities
in California at present. (I do not know whether any psychologist has
investigated the development of the ability to understand this feature of
natural numbers - Piaget seems most likely. Do any mathematics teachers teach
or test for this?)
<p>
<b>o</b>
1-1 correspondences can be used for a wide variety of different purposes,
including
<br>
- providing factual information, e.g. answering questions (how many dishes are
there?),
<br>
- achieving many practical goals (e.g. fetching enough dishes for the people in
the room),
<br>
- (presumably later on) counting repetitions of placements of a short object
against a longer object, in order to compare sizes of objects that cannot easily
be moved together for the purposes of comparison, e.g. selecting which of two
tree-trunks to cut to make a mast or centre-pole for a hut,
<br>
- and probably many more uses going back further in human history than records
of the uses.
<p>
<b>o</b>
It is possible to notice certain recurring patterns in the uses of such symbols
for which exceptions are impossible, e.g.  if two non-overlapping unchanging
collections of three items and five items are treated as one larger collection,
then the process of counting elements of the larger collection in standard ways
will always give the same result: eight items. (This is an expanded version of
one of Kant's examples.)

<p>
<b>o</b>
The relationship of being in a 1-1 correspondence is not affected by
permutations of the members of either set. E.g. since [P Q R] and [cat mouse
dog] are in 1-1 correspondence, so are [P Q R] and [dog mouse cat]: order of
elements of the collection does not affect existence of a 1-1 correspondence
even though every such correspondence makes use of an ordering of each set.
<p>
<b>o</b>
The existence of a 1-1 correspondence between two collections is not affected by
overlaps between the two collections or differences of ordering in the two
collections. For example, the existence of a 1-1 correspondence between [pig dog
cat plum rock] and [ball rock tree pig cloud] is not affected by the fact that
there are common elements in a different order in the two collections.
<p>
<b>o</b>
Being in a 1-1 correspondence is a <b>transitive</b> and <b>symmetric</b> relation
between collections. (It follows that the relation is also <b>reflexive</b>.)
These concepts are defined here
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation#Relations_over_a_set">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation#Relations_over_a_set</a>
<p>
E.g. if elements of collection A are in one-to-one
correspondence
with elements of collection B, and elements of collection B are in one-to-one
correspondence with elements of C, then there is a one-to-one correspondence
between elements of A and elements of C. C could be a set containing the same
elements as B at a later time, with the elements re-arranged as in
<a href="#fig8-transitive">Figure 8-Transitive</a>.
<p>
A special case, studied in depth by Piaget
(<a href="#piaget-number">[1952]</a>):
How can a child come to understand that physically rearranging a collection of
items cannot alter the number of items in the collection, even if the various
aspects of the space they occupy change? This seems to involve the ability to
understand not only special cases, like the one shown in
<a href="#fig8-transitive">Figure 8-Transitive</a>, but general "invariants" of
one-to-one mappings.

<blockquote>
If elements of set A (on left) are in 1-1 correspondence with elements of B in
the middle, and elements of B are in 1-1 correspondence with elements of
another set C, on the right, then the two correspondences can be "joined" to
form a 1-1 correspondence between elements of A and elements of C. This
correspondence is not affected by the way elements of the sets are distributed
in space: e.g. one set may be compact and another stretched out.
Likewise for sets of events with different time-intervals between the events.
</blockquote>

Understanding the concept of cardinal number includes understanding why a
one-to-one correspondence between two collections of discrete items is preserved
no matter how the items are re-arranged (which can be seen as an application of
transitivity). It also involves understanding that the relationship is
symmetric: if there is a 1-1 correspondence between sets A and B, then there is
necessarily a 1-1 correspondence between B and A. Piaget's work showed that such
understanding does not come automatically with being able to count or to answer
questions correctly in special cases. But I suspect that neither Piaget nor
anyone else knows how brains represent information about particular one-to-one
mappings or acquire abstract non-empirical knowledge about general properties of
transformations that involve one-to-one mappings.
<a href="#frege-grundlagen">Frege 1950</a>
attempted to show that such mathematical knowledge is purely logical, but it is
clear that mathematicians understood these properties of cardinality before the
logical apparatus used by Frege had been discovered. The mechanisms originally
described in this chapter (in 1978) merely illustrate possible explanations of a
tiny subset of competences involving natural numbers.
<p>
I don't think Piaget knew anything about the sorts of computational
(information-processing) mechanisms described in this chapter. So he was able to
characterise observable differences in performance but could not explain them.
Many researchers attempted to replicate, or modify his experiments, but often
labelled what they were studying as something like "understanding conservation",
without any theory of what made such understanding possible. A useful summary
by Saul McLeod with videos can be found here:
<a href="http://www.simplypsychology.org/concrete-operational.html">http://www.simplypsychology.org/concrete-operational.html</a>
<p>
<b>o</b>
Many relationships can be discovered between two (or more) collections. For
example if collections A and B are not in a one to one correspondence then
either A corresponds one to one with a subset of B, or B does to a subset of A,
depending which collection has left-over items whenever the elements are paired.
Changing the pairing of elements in A and B cannot affect which one has items
left over. That's because combining (chaining) the mapping in which B has items
left over with the mapping in which A has items left over can produce a mapping
of A to itself in which all elements of A map 1-1 onto a subset of elements of
A, which is impossible for a finite set A. (Creating a diagram should make this
clear.)
<p>
<b>o</b>
There cannot be a largest collection of objects, because whatever collection is
considered largest an additional item, real or imagined, can always be added to
the collection to produce a new larger collection. (Was this the basis of the
original discovery of the concept of "infinity"?)
<p>
<b>o</b>
There are operations by which two collections of unique objects can be used to
form a new collection. For example, combining two collections and making sure
that any item that occurs in both is represented by two distinct items in the
combined collection can be used to define the sum of two numbers, i.e. addition.
Defining the difference between two numbers, i.e. subtraction, is a little more
complicated. Defining multiplication (the product) of two numbers can start with
two collections and A and B use them to build a third collection C in which each
element of A is represented multiple times, by pairing it with each element of
B.  E.g starting with two collections:
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>
    [tom mary] [cat dog pig]
</b></pre>
</font>
we can create the new collection:
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>
    [ [tom  cat] [tom  dog] [tom  pig]
      [mary cat] [mary dog] [mary big] ]
</b></pre>
</font>
Learning about such operations can provide a basic understanding of
multiplication (which does not eliminate the need to memorise multiplication
tables for practical purposes, once the principles are understood; educators
who think that understanding eliminates the need for memorizing do not
understand mathematics).
<p>
<b>o</b>
A great deal of primary school mathematical education involves coming to
understand a collection of mathematical theories, not all of which are made
explicit by the teachers, sometimes because their own understanding is
incomplete. This is particularly likely to be true of their understanding of the
natural numbers, though the same can be true of geometry teaching.
<p>
<b>o</b>
A serious challenge for neuroscience is to explain how all of this information
about 1-1 correspondences and their uses could be represented in brains, and how
it gets there. E.g. what sorts of changes in the brain of a child make it
possible for Piaget's older subjects to have competences they lacked a few
months earlier? What sorts of mechanisms bring about those changes? What further
changes are required to enable a child to develop into a mathematician able to
make the sorts of discoveries that had already been made over 2000 years ago, by
Euclid or his predecessors, such as the discovery that some numbers are prime,
and that there are infinitely many prime numbers. What sorts of evolutionary
processes made it possible for humans to make discoveries about numbers (and
geometry) that are not possible for other intelligent species? Such questions
are central to the Turing-inspired Meta-Morphogenesis project, begun in 2011.

<b>Note about avoiding a rule for generating number names</b>
<br>
(Added: 17 Apr 2017)
<br>
Following a discussion with Aviv Keren about similarities and differences
between cardinals and ordinals, I realised for the first time that the ability
to make practical use of cardinality of arbitrarily large collections does not,
in theory, require a memorised rule for generating unique number names in a
standard order, used as explained above in <a href="#chap8">this chapter</a>,
since a brain could in principle generate and store a structured "model" for any
set of objects encountered, and could tell whether two such sets are
equinumerous by searching for a set of one-to-one linkages between the two
stored models.
<p>
So in principle instead of counting a collection of 25 people and remembering
the label "25", a brain could (in theory) generate a collection of distinct
(arbitrary) items in one-to-one correspondence with the collection of people.
Then on later encountering a set of bicycles it might generate another
collection of distinct items in one-to-one correspondence with the bicycles.
<p>
Later the question whether there were more bicycles than people it could grow
bi-unique links between the elements of the two sets. If this turns   out to be
impossible the numbers are not the same. If such a collection of links is grown
that will show that the two numbers are the same. Later the same thing could be
done when comparing the set of people with a collection of chairs. Moreover
there is no need for the people, or bicycles,
or chairs, to be linked in the same
order every time this is done. In that case each stored collection can
represent the number common to many different collections, without assuming that
setting up one-to-one correspondences is done using any standard ordering.
<p>
Before I realised this I thought that the ability to be able to compare sizes of
arbitrarily large collections of discrete items depended on a memorised
mechanism for reliably generating numerals (number names) in a fixed sequence in
one to one correspondence with a collection of other objects. In principle, that
is not needed, but in practice the storage requirements for ordinal-free use of
cardinality would be explosive, so the use of a memorised program for reliably
generating new number names in a determinate order is essential.

Computers in Schools

Note added in 2001, about 25 years after the book was written

<div style="margin-left:15px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px;">
Alas it seems that too much of education regarding use of computers in schools
is now just another case of teaching students to be passive users of complex
systems that others have produced, like teaching them to drive cars. The
opportunity to use computers in the way that meccano sets are sometimes used for
educational purposes, has largely been ignored.
<p>
If it had not been ignored, children would be learning how to design, implement,
test, debug, analyse, describe, explain and criticise increasingly complex
working systems. But their minds are not being trained to deal with all the
complex systems they will encounter in real life, including social systems,
political systems, economic systems, computing systems, and human minds,
including their own. If it had not been ignored, people starting training to be
psychologists would have had experience of building and testing systems that
manipulate and use information structures far more complex than the one depicted
in Figure 6.
<p>
The phrase "mouse potato" can be used by analogy with "couch potato", once used
to describe passive watchers of television programmes. The generation of couch
potatoes who passively, for hours on end, watched television programmes produced
by others is educating a generation of mouse potatoes who "passively" use
software products produced by others.

Fortunately the recently developed "Computing at School" movement begun in 2009
and embraced by the UK government around 2012 is changing this, but still with a
vision that is too narrow: focusing on computing as fun and useful, and relevant
to degrees in computer science and the job market, but not really including its

<br>
Probabilistic (associative) vs structural learning
</b></h3>

<div style="margin-left:15px; margin-top:-10px; margin-bottom:10px;">
At the time I was writing this chapter (in the early 1970s) I was aware that
there were many people trying to explain learning in terms of probabilistic
associations. Although this seemed to be a good description of some of the
intermediate stages in learning about numbers, e.g. before a child is reliably
able to recite the number sequence, probabilistic associations did not seem to
characterise adequately the rich and precise grasp of structure that comes with
a deep understanding of the world of numbers, including not only the ability to
answer the simple sorts of questions discussed in this chapter, but also the
ability to think about infinite sets (e.g. the set of even numbers or the set of
prime numbers) the ability to discover new regularities in the structure, the
ability to invent new, provably correct procedures e.g. for doing long
multiplication or finding square roots, and so on.
<p>
Part of all this is the ability to understand the difference between
the <I>necessary, exceptionless,</I> truths of number theory, such as
that seven plus five equals 12, or that the cardinality of a set is
independent of the order in which the elements are counted
and merely <I>contingent</I> truths, such as that if you put one rabbit in an
empty hutch and then later add another rabbit, and do not put any
additional rabbits in the hutch there will be only two rabbits in the
hutch thereafter.
<p>
In other words I was convinced that although the processes involved in
learning some of the basic features of the number system, including the
names for the numbers and their order, might use probabilistic
mechanisms (such as the neural nets that became popular in the two
decades following publication of this book),
this could not be the key either to the nature of our
mathematical knowledge, or to many other features of our knowledge of
the world, such as understanding how a clock works, or why turning a
handle can enable a door to be opened, or why it is necessary
to open the door in order to go into a room. When we understand these
things we do not merely understand probabilistic associations, we
understand <I>structural relationships</I>. (This theme is still being developed
on my web site, e.g. in these documents:
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/impossible.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/impossible.html</a>

<p>
By the early 1970's there had already been some deep work in AI
investigating structure-based learning and understanding, e.g. the
papers in Minsky's 1968 collection, and Sussman. (Progress
was very slow, however, because of the extremely limited speeds and
memory capacities of computers of the time, but more importantly because
the sheer difficulty of the problems.)
<p>

When I wrote this chapter, I was attempting to generalise some of that early
work by exploring the hypothesis that a human's (mostly unconscious) ability:

<ol type="a">
<li>to
construct and then inspect and manipulate list structures (or
similar structures found in computational virtual machines)
<li>to create, inspect, run, and manipulate (including de-bugging) the
procedures for operating on those structures
<li>to run processes in parallel, including processes observing
and modifying other processes, for example running a process of pointing and a
process of counting and a third process monitoring the first two and keeping
them synchronised,
</ol>
could explain a wider and deeper range of possible phenomena than mere learning
of associations could, adding depth and precision to otherwise vague or
under-specified theories about development of number competences; and possibly
even suggesting new theory-based approaches to the teaching of number
competences. Examples might include introducing games that help to develop the
internal information processing competences described here. (In my student days,
university level mathematics teaching involved setting carefully designed
exercises that developed relevant internal information processing competences,
e.g. learning to recognise situations in which certain otherwise useful
techniques are not appropriate, and understanding why, though this may not have
been fully understood by all the teachers.)
<p>
I also suggested that if some of the list structures did not have a
fixed order but were re-linked, e.g. bringing more recently accessed
items closer to the front, then that could explain some of the
variability in performance that others had assumed must be explained by
probabilistic mechanisms.
<p>
In retrospect, it seems that a mixture of the probabilistic and
deterministic approaches is required, within the study of <I>architectures</I>
for complete agents: a more general study than the investigation of
algorithms and representations that dominated most of the early work on
AI (partly because of the dreadful limitations of speed and memory of
even the most expensive and sophisticated computers available in the
1960s and 1970s).
<p>
There are many ways such hybrid mechanisms could be
implemented, and my recent work on different processing layers
within an integrated architecture (combining reactive, deliberative and
meta-management layers) indicates some features of a hybrid
system, with probabilistic associations dominating the reactive layer
and structure manipulations being more important in the (more
recently evolved) deliberative and meta-management
layers. For recent papers on this see

<h3><b>Note on <i>Wild Minds</i> added January 2002, extended Feb 2016</b></h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;">
In the book <I>Wild Minds: What animals really think</I>, by Marc Hauser
(Penguin Books 2001), Chapter 3, entitled "Number juggling", discusses and
compares the understanding of numbers in very young children and in other
animals. Hauser comes close to asking some of the questions asked here, and
includes some speculations about possible mechanisms, but does not seem to be
aware of the full variety of architectures and sub-mechanisms that might explain
the observed evidence.
<p>
He points out that it is very easy to assume that the observed behaviours of
animals suggest a unique interpretation, until we start exploring possible
mechanisms that might produce those behaviours. He implicitly acknowledges that
such mechanisms can be described at different levels of abstraction, not only at
the level of brain physiology.
<p>
I am not sure that he understands all the requirements for (cardinal) number
comprehension summarised in the note  added

In 2009 at a Cognitive Science conference I learnt that ideas about number
competences related to those presented here had been developed independently by
Heike Wiese, who discusses the evolutionary role of language in developing
counting competences.

Her work emphasises the role of recursion in enabling language users to produce
increasingly complex names for numbers, whereas for a programmer both recursion
and iteration are available. My examples in this chapter use iteration both in
the production of new number names and in the practical uses of number names
including matching up sets of objects.
<p>
Wiese emphasises the use of relational structures in language to represent and
characterise relational structures of objects (e.g. cardinality, ordinality),
whereas this chapter explains how internal computational processes, sometimes
controlling external behaviours such as repeated pointing, or repeated transfer
of objects from one location to another, can (in principle) explain multiple
<i>practical</i> uses of relational structures, including linguistic and
non-linguistic structures.
<p>
The evolution of human linguistic capabilities may have built on pre-existing
mechanisms required for perception, for intention formation, for control of
actions, etc. The use of those mechanisms as a basis for numerical competences
seems at first sight to have built on prior use of the mechanisms for linguistic
communication. But perhaps different evolutionary trajectories are possible, in
which some numerical competences precede evolution of linguistic communication.
(An unobvious example might be the use of iterated structures in a genome to
control development of multiple components in an organism, e.g. the vertebrae
-- one of many ways in which evolution made use of mathematical structures
long before individual organisms did.)

<div style="margin-left:15px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">
Work on the Turing-inspired Meta-Morphogenesis project, begun around 2011, led
to a view of biological evolution as a "Blind theorem prover", implicitly making
and using many mathematical discoveries, so that mathematical properties of
domains of structures could be used to constrain structures and processes,
without requiring special mechanisms to enforce the constraints. One of the
themes is that many animals have the ability to make and use mathematical
discoveries without being aware of what they are doing -- including pre-verbal
humans discovering "toddler theorems". For more on these topics see:

CHAPTER 9
<br>
PERCEPTION AS A COMPUTATIONAL PROCESS
</b></h2>
<p>
<a name="9.1."></a>
<h3><b>
<i>
9.1. Introduction
</i>
</b></h3>
In this chapter I wish to elaborate on a theme which Immanuel
Kant found obvious: there is no perception without prior
knowledge and abilities.
<p>
In the opening paragraphs of the Introduction to <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> he made claims about perception and
empirical knowledge which are very close to assumptions currently
made by people working on artificial intelligence projects
concerned with vision and language understanding. He
suggested that all our empirical knowledge is made up of
both 'what we receive through impressions' and of what 'our
own faculty of knowledge supplies from itself. That is,
perception is not a passive process of receiving information
through the senses, but an active process of analysis and
interpretation, in which 'schemata' control what happens. In
particular, the understanding has to 'work up the raw
material' by <i>comparing</i> representations, <i>combining</i> and
<i>separating</i> them. He also points out that we may not be in a
position to distinguish what we have added to the raw
material, 'until with long practice of attention we have
become skilled in separating it'. These ideas have recently
been re-invented and elaborated by some psychologists (for
example, Bartlett(1931)).
</p><p>
One way of trying to become skilled in separating the raw
material from what we have added is to attempt to design a
machine which can see. In so doing we learn that a great deal
of prior knowledge has to be programmed into the machine
before it can see even such simple things as squares, triangles,
or blocks on a table. In particular, as Kant foresaw, such a
machine has to use its knowledge in comparing its sense-data,
combining them into larger wholes, separating them,
describing them, and interpreting them as representing some other
reality. (This seems to contradict some of the claims made by
Ryle about perception, in his 1949, e.g. p. 229, last
paragraph.)

During 2005-6, while working on the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cosy/">CoSy robotic project</a>
I became increasingly aware that the ideas presented here and in several later
papers were too much concerned with perception of multi-layered <b>structures</b>,
ignoring perception of <b>processes</b>, especially concurrent perception of
processes at different levels of abstraction, and also perception of
<b>possible processes</b> and their limits. This  was discussed

<i>
9.2. Some computational problems of perception
</i>
</b></h3>
People have very complex perceptual abilities, some of them
shared with many animals. Especially difficult to explain is
the ability to perceive form and meaning in a complex and
messy collection of ambiguous and noisy data. For instance,
when looking at a tree we can make out twigs, leaves, flowers,
a bird's nest, spiders' webs and a squirrel. Similarly, we can
(sometimes) understand what is said to us in conversations at
noisy parties, we can read irregular handwriting, we can see
familiar objects and faces depicted in cartoons and 'modern'
paintings, and we can recognise a musical theme in many
different arrangements and variations.
<p>
Seeing the significance in a collection of experimental
results, grasping a character in a play or novel, and diagnosing
an illness on the basis of a lot of ill-defined symptoms, all
require this ability to make a 'Gestalt' emerge from a mass of
information. A much simpler example is our ability to see
something familiar in a picture like Figure 9.1. How does a
'Gestalt', a familiar word, emerge from all those dots?
</p><p>
Close analysis shows that this kind of ability is required
even for ordinary visual perception and speech understanding,
where we are totally unaware that we are interpreting untidy
and ambiguous sense-data. In order to appreciate these
unconscious achievements, try listening to very short extracts
from tapes of human speech (about the length of a single
word), or looking at manuscripts, landscapes, street scenes
and domestic objects through a long narrow tube. Try
looking at portions of Figure 7.1 through a hole about 3 mm in
diameter in a sheet of paper laid on the figure and moved
about. This helps to reveal how ambiguous and unclear the
details are, even when you think they are clear and
unambiguous. Boundaries are fuzzy, features indistinct, possible
interpretations of parts of our sense-data indeterminate.

<div style="margin-left:10px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; width:570px">
<i>
Fragments of this picture are quite ambiguous, yet somehow they help to
disambiguate one another, so that most people see a pile of letters
forming a familiar word. Often the word is seen before all the letters
are recognized, especially if noise is introduced making
recognition of the letters harder (e.g. if some dots are removed and
spurious dots added). Without knowledge of letters we would have no
strong reason to group some of the fragments, e.g. the top
of the "I" and the rest of the "I". The POPEYE program could also deal with
pictures containing added positive and negative noise illustrated below in
<a href="#fig9-a">Figure 9-new</a>.
</i>
</div>
</center>
<p>
Perceived fragments require
a context for their interpretation. The trouble is that the context
usually consists of other equally ambiguous, incomplete, or possibly
even spurious fragments. <br>
</p>
<p>Sometimes our expectations provide an additional context,
but this is not essential, since we can perceive and interpret
totally unexpected things, like a picture seen on turning a
page in a newspaper, or a sentence overheard on a bus.
</p>

<a name="9.3."></a>
<h3><b>
<i>
9.3. The importance of prior knowledge in perception
</i>
</b></h3>
What we can easily perceive and understand depends on what
we know. One who does not know English well will not be
able to hear the English sentences uttered at a noisy party, or
to read my handwriting! Only someone who knows a great
deal about Chemistry will see the significance in a collection
of data from chemical experiments. Only someone with a lot
of knowledge about lines, flat sheets, letters and words will
quickly see 'EXIT' in <a href="#fig9.1">Figure 9.1.</a>.
<p>
Perception uses knowledge and expertise in different ways,
clearly brought out by work on computer programs which
interpret pictures. One of the most striking features of all this
work is that it shows that very complex computational
processes are required for what appeared previously to be very
simple perceptual abilities, like seeing a block, or even seeing
a straight line as a line. These processes make use of many
different sorts of background knowledge, for instance in the
following conscious and unconscious achievements:
</p><p>
</p><ol type="a">
<li>Discerning features in the sensory array (for instance
discerning points of high contrast in the visual field),
<p></p>
</li>
<li>Deciding which features to group into significant larger units (e.g. which
dots to group into line segments in <a href="#fig9.1">Figure 9.1.</a>.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>Deciding which features to ignore because they are a result
of noise or coincidences, or irrelevant to the present task,
<p></p>
</li>
<li>Deciding to separate contiguous fragments which do not
really belong together (e.g. adjacent dots which are parts of
the boundaries of different letters),
<p></p>
</li>
<li>Making inferences which go beyond what is immediately
given (e.g. inferring that the edge of one bar continues
behind another bar, in Figure 9.1 ),
<p></p>
</li>
<li>Interpreting what is given, as a representation of something
quite different (e.g. interpreting a flat image as representing
a scene in which objects are at different depths: Figure 9.1 is
a very simple example),
<p></p>
</li>
<li>Noticing and using inconsistencies in an interpretation so as
to re-direct attention or re-interpret what is given.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>Recognising cues which suggest that a particular mode of
analysis is appropriate, or which suggest that a particular
type of structure is present in the image or the scene
depicted e.g. detecting the <i>style</i> of a picture.  This can
enable an intelligent system to avoid a lot of wasteful
searching for analyses and interpretations.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
So, perceiving structure or meaning may include using
knowledge to reject what is irrelevant (like background noise,
or coincidental juxtapositions) and to construct or hallucinate
what is not there at all. It is an active constructive process
which uses knowledge of the 'grammar' of sensory data, for
instance knowledge of the possible structures of retinal
images, knowledge about the kinds of things depicted or
represented by such data, and knowledge about the processes by
which objects generate sense-data. Kant's 'schemata' must
incorporate all this.
</p><p>
We need not be aware that we possess or use such
knowledge. As Kant noticed, it may be an 'art concealed in the
depths of the human soul' (p. 183, in Kemp Smith's
translation), much of it "compiled" into procedures and mechanisms
appropriate to images formed by the kind of world we live in.
But at present there are no better explanations of the
possibility of perception than explanations in terms of
intelligent processes using a vast store of prior information,
much of which is "compiled" (by evolution or by individual learning)
into procedures and mechanisms appropriate to images formed by the kind
of world we live in.
</p><p>
For instance, theories according to which some perception
is supposed to be 'direct', not involving any prior knowledge,
nor the use of concepts, seem to be quite vacuous. A theory
which claims that perceptual achievements are not
decomposable into sub-processes cannot be used as a basis for
designing
a working mind which can perceive any of the things we
perceive. It lacks explanatory power, because it lacks generative
power. If the processes cannot be decomposed, then there is
no way of generating the huge variety of human perceptual
abilities from a relatively economical subsystem. By contrast,
computational theories postulating the use of prior
knowledge of structures and procedures can begin to explain some
of the fine structure (see chapters 2 and 3) of perceptual
processes, for example, the perception of this as belonging to
that, this as going behind that, this as similar to that, this as
representing that, and so on.
</p><p>
Quibbles about whether the ordinary word 'knowledge' is
appropriate for talking about the mechanisms and the
stored facts and procedures used in perception seem to be merely
unproductive distractions. Even if the ordinary usage of the word
'knowledge' does not cover such inaccessible information, extending the
usage would be justified by the important insights gained thereby.
Alternatively, instead of talking about 'knowledge' we can talk about
'information' and say that even the simplest forms of perception not
only provide new information, in doing so they make use of various kinds
of prior information.
</p><p>
In a more complete discussion it would be necessary to
follow Kant and try to distinguish the role of knowledge
gained from previous perceptual experiences and the role of
knowledge and abilities which are required for any sort of
perceptual experience to get started. The latter cannot be
empirical in the same sense, though it may be the result of millions of
years of evolutionary "learning from experience".

</p><p>
Since our exploration of perceptual systems is still in a very
primitive state, it is probably
still too early to make any such distinctions with confidence.
It would also be useful to distinguish general knowledge
about a class of theoretically possible objects, situations,
processes, etc., from specific knowledge about commonly
occurring subsets. As remarked in chapter 2, we can distinguish
knowledge about the <i>form</i> of the world from knowledge
about its <i>contents.</i> Not all geometrically possible shapes are
to be found amongst animals, for example. A bat may in
some sense be half way between a mouse and a bird: but not
all of the intervening space is filled with actually existing
sorts of animals. If the known sorts of objects cluster into
relatively discrete classes, then this means that knowledge of
these classes can be used to short-circuit some of the more
general processes of analysis and interpretation which would
be possible. In information-theoretic terms this amounts to
an increase of redundancy  -- and a reduction of information
-- in sensory data. This is like saying that if you know a lot of
relatively commonly occurring words and phrases, then you
may be able to use this knowledge to cut down the search for
ways of interpreting everything you hear in terms of the most
general grammatical and semantic rules. (Compare Becker on
the 'phrasal lexicon'.) This is one of several ways in which the
environment can be cognitively 'friendly' or 'unfriendly'.
We evolved to cope with a relatively cognitively friendly environment.
</p><p>
In connection with pictures like <a href="#fig9.1">Figure 9.1</a>, this means
that if you know about particular letter-shaped configurations of bars, then
this knowledge may make it possible to find an interpretation of such a picture
in terms of bars more rapidly than if only general bar-configuration knowledge
were deployed. For instance, if you are dealing with our capital letters, then
finding a vertical bar with a horizontal one growing to the left from its
middle, is a very good reason for jumping to the conclusion that it is part of
an 'H', which means that you can expect another vertical bar at the left end of
the horizontal.
</p><p>
Thus a rational creature, concerned with maximising
efficiency of perceptual processing, might find it useful to
store a very large number of really quite redundant concepts,
corresponding to commonly occurring substructures (phrases)
which are useful discriminators and predictors.
</p><p>
The question of how different sorts of knowledge can most fruitfully interact is
a focus of much current research in artificial intelligence. The strategies
which work in a 'cognitively friendly world' where species of things cluster are
highly fallible if unusual situations occur. Nevertheless the fallible,
efficient procedures may be the most rational ones to adopt in a world where
things change rapidly, and your enemies may not give you time to search for a
<i>conclusive</i> demonstration that it is time to turn around and run. Thus
much of the traditional philosophical discussion of rationality, in terms of
what can be proved beyond doubt, is largely irrelevant to real life and the
design of intelligent machines. But new problems of rationality emerge in their
place, such as problems about trading space against time, efficiency against
flexibility or generality, and so on. From the design standpoint, rationality is
largely a matter of choosing among trade-offs in conditions of uncertainty, not
a matter of getting things 'right', or selecting the 'best'. (For more on
trade-offs see the chapters on representations, and on numbers:
<a href="#chap7">Chapter 7</a> and <a href="#chap8">Chapter 8</a>)).
<p>
<a name="9.4."></a>
<h3><b>
<i>
9.4. Interpretations
</i>
</b></h3>
Knowledge is used both in analysing structures of images and
in interpreting those structures as depicting something else.
There may be several different layers of interpretation.
For example in Figure 9.1, above, dot configurations represent
configurations of lines. These in turn represent configurations of
bars. These represent strokes composing letters. And sequences
of letters can represent words (see fig. 6). Within each layer
there may be alternative structures discernible, for instance
alternative ways of grouping things, alternative relations which
may be noticed. These will affect the alternative
interpretations of that layer. By examining examples in some detail
and trying to design mechanisms making the different
experiences possible we can gain new insights into the complex and
puzzling concept of 'seeing as', discussed at length in part II
of Wittgenstein's <i>Philosophical Investigations.</i>
<p>
Contrary to what many people (including some
philosophers) have assumed, there need not be any similarity
between what represents and what it represents. Instead, the
process of interpretation may use a variety of interpretation
rules, of which the most obvious would be rules based on
information about a process of projection which generates,
say, a two-dimensional image from a three-dimensional scene.
(For more on this see the chapter on analogical representations.)
</p><p>
The projection of a three dimensional scene onto a two
dimensional image is just a special case of a more general
notion of <i>evidence</i> which is generated in a systematic way by
that which explains it. A two-dimensional projection of a
three-dimensional object bears very little similarity to the
object. (Cf. Goodman, <i>Languages of Art.)</i> The
interpretation
procedure may allow for the effects of the transformations
and distortions in the projection (as a scientist measuring the
temperature of some liquid may allow for the fact that the
thermometer cools the liquid).
</p><p>
This is an old idea: what is new in the work of A.I. is the detailed
analysis of such transformations and interpretation procedures, and
the adoption of new standards for the acceptability of an explanation:
namely it must suffice to generate a working system, that is, a program
which can use knowledge of the transformations to interpret pictures or
the images produced by a television camera connected to the computer.
</p><p>
What we are conscious of seeing is the result of many layers
of such interpretation, mostly unconscious, yet many of them are
essentially
similar in character to intellectual processes of which we are
sometimes conscious. All this will be obvious to anyone familiar with
recent work in theoretical linguistics.
</p><p>
So the familiar philosophical argument that we do not see
things as they are, because our sense-organs may affect the
information we receive, is invalid. For however much our
sense-organs affect incoming data, we may still be able to
interpret the data in terms of how things really are. But this
requires the use of knowledge and inference procedures, as
people trying to make computers see have discovered. Where
does the background knowledge come from? Presumably a
basis is provided genetically by what our species has learnt
from millions of years of evolution. The rest has to be
constructed, from infancy onwards, by individuals, with and
without help, and mostly unconsciously.

<i>
9.5. Can physiology explain perception?
</i>
</b></h3>
To say that such processes are unconscious does not imply
that they are physiological  as people sometimes assume in
discussions of such topics. Physical and physiological theories
about processes in the brain cannot account for these
perceptual and interpretative abilities, except possibly at the
very lowest levels, like the ability to detect local colour
contrasts in the visual field. Such tasks can be delegated to
physical mechanisms because they are relatively determinate
and context-independent, that is algorithmic (e.g. see Marr,
1976). In particular, such peripheral processes need not
involve the construction and testing of rival hypotheses about
how to group fragments of information and how to interpret
features of an image. But, physical and physiological
mechanisms cannot cope with the more elaborate context-dependent
problem-solving processes required for perception. The
concept of using stored knowledge to interpret information has
no place in physics or physiology, even though a physical
system may serve as the computer in which information is stored
and perceptual programs executed.
<p>
Moreover, even colour contrasts can sometimes be
hallucinated on the basis of context, as so-called
'illusory-contrasts'
show. For an example see <a href="#fig9.2">Figure 2</a>.

Instead of physiological theories, we need 'computational
theories, that is, theories about processes in which symbolic
representations of data are constructed and manipulated. In
such processes, facts about part of an image are interpreted
by making inferences using context and background
knowledge. We must not be blinded by philosophical or
terminological prejudices which will not allow us to describe
unconscious processes as inferences, or, more generally, as 'mental processes'.<br>
<p>How is it done? In particular, what exactly is the
knowledge required for various kinds of perception, and how do we
mobilise it as needed? We cannot yet claim to have complete
or even nearly complete explanations. But A.I. work on vision
has made some significant progress, both in showing up the
inadequacies of bad theories and sketching possible fragments
of correct explanations.
</p><blockquote>
<i>
Our present ignorance is not a matter of our not knowing which theory is
correct, but of our not even knowing how to formulate theories
sufficiently rich in explanatory power to be worth testing
experimentally.
</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
Attempting to program computers to simulate human
achievements provides a powerful technique for finding
inadequacies in our theories thereby stimulating the rapid
development of new theory-building tools. In the process we
are forced to re-examine some old philosophical and
psychological problems. For a survey of some of this work, see the
chapters on computer vision in Boden (1977). Winston
(1975) also includes useful material, especially the sections
by Winston, Waltz, and Minsky. The rest of this chapter
illustrates some of the problems with reference to an ongoing
computer project at Sussex University, which may be taken
as representative.

<h3><b>
<i>
9.6. Can a computer do what we do?
</i>
</b></h3>
We are exploring some of the problems of visual perception by attempting to give
a computer the ability to perceive a configuration of known shapes in a scene
depicted by a 'spotty' picture like <a href="#fig9.1">Figure 9.1.</a> The
pictures are presented to the program in the form of a 2-dimensional binary
(i.e. black and white) array. The array is generated by programs in the computer
either on the basis of instructions, or with the aid of a graphical input
terminal. Additional spurious dots ('positive noise') can be added to make the
pictures more confusing. Similarly, spurious gaps ('negative noise') can be
added.
<p>
People can cope quite well with these pictures even when
there is a lot of positive and negative noise, and where further
confusion is generated by overlaps between letters, and
confusing juxtapositions. Some people have trouble at first, but
after seeing one or two such pictures, they interpret new ones
much more rapidly. The task of the program is to find
familiar letters without wasting a lot of time investigating spurious
interpretations of ambiguous fragments. It should 'home in
on' the most plausible global interpretation fairly rapidly, just
as people can.
</p><p>
Out of context, picture details are suggestive but highly
ambiguous, as can be seen by looking at various parts of the
picture through a small hole in a sheet of paper. Yet when we
see them in context we apparently do not waste time
exploring all the alternative interpretations. It is as if different
ambiguous fragments somehow all 'communicate' with one
another in parallel, to disambiguate one another.
</p><p>
Waltz (1975) showed how this sort of mutual
disambiguation could be achieved by a program for interpreting line
drawings representing a scene made up of blocks on a table,
illuminated by a shadow-casting light. He gave his program
prior knowledge of the possible interpretations of various
sorts of picture junctions, all of which were ambiguous out of
context. So the problem was to find a globally consistent
interpretation of the whole picture. The program did
surprisingly well on quite complex pictures. His method involved
letting possible interpretations for a fragment be 'filtered out'
when not consistent with any possible interpretations for
neighbouring fragments.

<blockquote>
<b>[[Note added 2001:</b>
<br>
<small>
since 1975 there have been huge developments in
techniques for 'constraint propagation', including both hard and soft
constraints.
</small>
<b>]]</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
But the input to Waltz' program was a representation of a
perfectly connected and noise-free line drawing. Coping with
disconnected images which have more defects, requires more
prior knowledge about the structure of images and scenes
depicted, and more sophisticated computational mechanisms.
</p><p>
Which dots in Figure 9.1 should be grouped into collinear
fragments? By looking closely at the picture, you should be
able to discern many more collinear groups than you
previously noticed. That is, there are some lines which 'stand
out' and are used in building an interpretation of the picture,
whereas others for which the picture contains evidence are
not normally noticed. Once you have noticed that a certain
line 'stands out', it is easy to look along it picking out all the
dots which belong to it, even though some of them may be
'attracted' by other lines too.
</p><p>
But how do you decide which lines stand out without first
noticing all the collinear groups of dots? Are all the collinear
dot-strips noticed unconsciously? What does that mean? Is
this any different from unconsciously noticing grammatical
relationships which make a sentence intelligible?
</p><p>
When pictures are made up of large numbers of
disconnected and untidy fragments, then the interpretation problem
is compounded by the problem of deciding which fragments
to link together to form larger significant wholes. This is the
'segmentation' or 'agglomeration' problem. As so often
happens in the study of mental processes, we find a circularity:
once a fragment has been interpreted this helps to determine
the others with which it should be linked, and once
appropriate links have been set up the larger fragment so formed
becomes less ambiguous and easier to interpret. It can then
function as a recognisable cue. (The same circularity is
relevant to understanding speech.)

<h3><b>
<i>
9.7. The POPEYE program</i></b>
<small>
<a href="#chap9-note1">[1]</a>
</small>
</h3>
Our computer program breaks out of this circularity by
sampling parts of the image until it detects a number of
unambiguous fragments suggesting the presence of lines. It can
then use global comparisons between different lines to see
which are supported most strongly by relatively unambiguous
fragments. These hypothesised bold lines then direct closer
examination of their neighbourhoods to find evidence for
bar-projections. Evidence which would be inconclusive out of
context becomes significant in the context of a nearby bold
line hypothesised as the edge of a bar  an example of a
'Gestalt' directing the interpretation of details.
<p>
Thus, by using the fact that <i>some</i> fragments are fairly
unambiguous, we get the process started. By using the fact that
long stretches of relatively unambiguous fragments are
unlikely to be spurious, the program can control further analysis
and interpretations. Parallel pairs of bold lines are used as
evidence for the presence of a bar. Many of the strategies
used are highly fallible. They depend on assumption that
the program inhabits a 'cognitively friendly' world, that is, that it
will not be asked to interpret very messy, very confusing pictures.
If it is, then, like people, it will become confused and start
floundering.
</p><p>
Clusters of bar-like fragments found in this way can act as
cues to generate further higher-level hypotheses, for example,
letter hypotheses, which in turn control the interpretation of
further ambiguous fragments. (For more details, see Sloman
and Hardy 'Giving a computer gestalt experiences' and Sloman
<i>et al.</i> 1978.) In order to give a program a more complete
understanding of <i>our</i> concepts, we would need to embody it
in a system that was able to move about in space and
manipulate physical objects, as people do. This sort of thing is being
done in other artificial intelligence research centres. However,
there are still many unsolved problems. It will be a long time
before the perceptual and physical skills of even a very young
child can be simulated.
</p><p>
The general method of using relatively unambiguous
fragments to activate prior knowledge which then directs attention
fruitfully at more ambiguous fragments, seems to be required
at all levels in a visual system. It is sometimes called the
'cue-schema' method, and seems to be frequently re-invented.
</p><p>
However, it raises serious problems, such as: how should an
intelligent mechanism decide which schemas are worth
storing in the first place, and how should it, when confronted with
some cue, find the <i>relevant</i> knowledge in a huge memory
store? (Compare chapter 8.) A variety of sophisticated
indexing strategies may be required for the latter purpose. Another
important problem is how to control the invocation of
schemas when the picture includes cues for many different
schemas.
</p><p>
Our program uses knowledge about many different kinds
of objects and relationships, and runs several different sorts
of processes in parallel, so that 'high-level' processes and
(relatively) low-level' processes can help one another resolve
ambiguities and reduce the amount of searching for consistent
interpretations. It is also possible to suspend processes which
are no longer useful, for example low-level analysis processes,
looking for evidence of lines, may be terminated prematurely
if some higher-level process has decided that enough has been
learnt about the image to generate a useful interpretation.
</p><p>
This corresponds to the fact that we may recognise a whole
(e.g. a word) without taking in all its parts. It is rational for
an intelligent agent to organise things this way in a rapidly
changing world where the ability to take quick decisions may
be a matter of life and death.
</p><p>
Like people, the program can notice words and letters
emerging out of the mess in pictures like Figure 9.1. As Kant
says, the program has to work up the raw material by
comparing representations, combining them, separating them,
classifying them, describing their relationships, and so on.
What Kant failed to do was describe such processes in detail.

<h3><b>
<i>
9.8. The program's knowledge
</i>
</b></h3>
In dealing with Figure 9.1 the program needs to know about
several different domains of possible structures, depicted in
Figure <a name="fig9.3">9.3:</a>
<p>
The domains of knowledge involved include:
<ol type="a">
<li>The domain of 2-dimensional configurations of dots in a
discrete rectangular array (the "dotty picture" domain).
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>The domain of 2-dimensional configurations of
line-segments in a continuous plane. The configurations in the dotty
picture domain <i>represent</i> configurations of
such lines -- notice the differences between a collection of dots
<i>being</i> a line segment, <i>lying on</i> a line segment and
<i>representing</i> a line segment.

</li>
<li>The (two-and-a-half-dimensional) domain of overlapping
laminas composed of 'bars'. Patterns in the line-domain
<p></p>
</li>
<li>represent configurations of bars and laminas made of
rectangular bars.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>An abstract domain containing configurations of 'strokes'
which have orientations, lengths, junctions, and so on,
analogous to lines, but with looser criteria for identity.
Letters form a subset of this domain. Configurations in
this domain are represented by configurations of
laminas. That is, a bar-shaped lamina represents a
possible stroke in a letter, but strokes of letters can also be
depicted by quite different patterns (as in this printed
text)  which is why I say their domain is 'abstract' following Clowes,
1971.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>An abstract domain consisting of sequences of letters.
Known words form a subset of this domain.
</li>
</ol>
Figure 9.3, below, illustrates some of the possible contents of the 2-D Domains
used by the Popeye program in interpreting images like <a href="#fig9.1">Figure

</div>

</center>

</p>
<p>
</p>
In particular the program has to know how to build and relate
descriptions of structures in each of these domains, including
fragments of structures. That is, the ability to solve problems
about a domain requires an 'extension' of the domain to
include possible fragments of well-formed objects in the
domain  Becker's 'phrasal lexicon' again. Our program uses
many such intermediate concepts. Figures
<a href="#fig9.3">9.3</a>
and
<a href="#fig9.4">9.4</a>
list and
illustrate some of the concepts relevant to the second and
third domains. Figure 5 shows some of the cues that can
help reduce the search for an interpretation.

<a href="#fig9.6">Figure 9.6</a> shows all the domains and some of the
structural correspondences between
items in those domains.<p>
By making use of the notion of a series of domains, providing different
'layers' of interpretation, it is possible to contribute to the analysis
of the concept of 'seeing as', which has puzzled some philosophers.
Seeing X as Y is in general a matter of constructing a mapping between a
structure in one domain and a possibly different structure in another
domain. The mapping may use several intermediate layers.
<br>
</p><blockquote>
<b>[[Note added 2001:</b>
<br>
our recent work on architectures containing a
'meta-management' layer suggests that
<i>
being aware of seeing X as Y
</i>
requires additional meta-management, i.e. self-monitoring processes,
which are not essential for the basic processes of
<i>seeing X as Y</i>,
which could occur in simpler architectures, e.g. in
animals that are not aware of their own mental processes (like most AI
systems so far).

Some concepts relevant to the domain of overlapping rectangular laminas. This
sort of domain is sometimes described as "two and a half dimensional" (2.5D)
because one object can be nearer or further than another, and because all or
part of an object can be invisible because it is hidden behind another, unlike a
purely 2D domain where everything is visible. Knowledge of such 2.5D concepts
can help the search for a good interpretation of pictures like Figure 1. This
raises problems about how the concepts are stored and indexed, how they are
accessed by cues, and how ambiguities are resolved. Some of the discussion in
<a href="#chap6">Chapter 6</a> regarding special purpose and general purpose
monitors is relevant.
</em>
<p>
<img src="fig9.4.gif" alt="[fig9.4]" align="middle" style="width: 450px;">

</div>
</center>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Facts about one domain may help to solve problems about
any of the others. For instance, lexical knowledge may lead
to a guess that if the letters 'E', 'X' and T' have been found,
with an unclear letter between them, then the unclear letter is
'I'. This in turn leads to the inference that there is a lamina
depicting the 'I' in the scene. From that it follows that
unoccluded edges of the lamina will be represented by lines in
the hypothetical picture in domain (b). The inferred locations
of these lines can lead to a hypothesis about which dots in
the picture should be grouped together, and may even lead to
the conclusion that some dots which are not there should be
there.
</p><p>
The program, like a person, needs to know that a horizontal
line-segment in its visual image can represent (part of) the top
or bottom edge of a bar, that an ELL junction between line
segments can depict part of either a junction between two
bars or a corner of a single bar. In the former case it may
depict either a concave or a convex corner, and, as always,
context will have to be used to decide which.
</p><p>
The program does not need to define concepts of one
domain in terms of concepts from another. Rather the
different domains are defined by their own primitive concepts and
relations. The notion of 'being represented by' is not the
same as the notion of 'being defined in terms of'. For instance,
'bar' is not defined in terms of actual and possible sense-data
in the dot-picture domain, as some reductionist philosophical
theories of perception would have us believe. Concepts from
each domain are defined implicitly for the program in terms
of structural relations and inference rules, including
interpretation strategies.
</p><p>
So the organisation of the program is more consistent with
a dualist or pluralist and wholistic metaphysics than with an
idealist or phenomenalist reduction of the external world to
sense-data, or any form of philosophical atomism, such as
Russell and Wittgenstein once espoused.

<i>
9.9.    Learning
</i>
</b></h3>
Programs, like people, can in principle work out lots of things
for themselves, instead of having them all programmed
explicitly. For instance Figure 5 shows typical line-picture
fragments which can be generated by laminas occluding one
another. A program could build up a catalogue of such things
for itself for instance by examining lots of drawings. Research
is in progress on the problem of designing systems which
learn visual concepts, possibly with the help of a teacher who
chooses examples for the system to work on. (For example,
see Winston, 1975.) It is certain that there are many more
ways of doing such things than we have been able to think of
so far.
So we are in no position to make claims about which
gives the best theory of how people learn.
<br>
</p><blockquote>
<b>[[Note added 2001:</b>
<br>
In the decades since this book was written many more learning methods
have been developed for vision and other aspects of intelligence,
though surprisingly few of them seem to involve the ability to learn
about different classes of structures in domains linked by
representation relationships. Many of them attempt to deal with
fairly direct mappings between configurations detectable in image
sequences and abstract concepts like "person walking". For examples see
journals and conference proceedings on machine vision, pattern
recognition, and machine learning.<b>]]</b>

<p>
Currently our program starts with knowledge which has
been given it by people (just as people have to start with
knowledge acquired through a lengthy process of biological
evolution). Perhaps, one day, some of the knowledge will be
acquired by a machine itself, interacting with the world, if
a television camera and mechanical arm are connected to
the computer, as is already done in some A.I. research
laboratories. However, real learning requires much more
sophisticated programs than programs which have a fixed collection
of built-in abilities. (Some of the problems of learning were
discussed previously in <a href="#chap6">Chapter 6</a>
and <a href="#chap8">Chapter 8</a>.)

Likewise in depictions of forest scenes, commonly
occurring configurations in the "dotty picture" domain would be
different from those found in Figure <a href="#fig9.1">9.1</a>.

Knowledge of commonly occurring sub-structures in images, corresponding
to particular domains represented,

grammar which subsumes those phrases. (Becker 1975)

</blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>
Given structural definitions of letters, and knowledge of the relations
between the different domains illustrated in Figure 6, a program might
be able to work out or learn from experience that certain kinds
of bar junctions (Figure 4), or the corresponding
2-D line configurations (Figures 3 and 5),
occur only in a few of them, and thus are
useful disambiguating cues. This will not be true of all the
fragments visible in Figure 1. Thus many fragments will not
be recognised as familiar, and spurious linkages and
hypotheses will therefore not be generated. If the program were
familiar with a different world, in which other fragments
were significant, then it might he more easily be confused by
Figure 1. So additional knowledge is not always helpful. (Many
works of art seem to require such interactions between
different domains of knowledge.)
</p><p>
A program should also be able to 'learn' that certain kinds
of fragments do not occur in any known letter, so that if they
seem to emerge at any stage this will indicate that picture
fragments have been wrongly linked together. This helps to
eliminate fruitless searches for possible interpretations. So the
discovery of anomalies and impossibilities may play an
important role in the development of rational behaviour. A
still more elaborate kind of learning would involve
discovering that whether a fragment is illegitimate depends on the
context. Fragments which are permissible within one
alphabet may not be permissible in another. Thus the process of
recognising letters is facilitated by knowledge of the alphabet
involved, yet some letter recognition may be required for the
type of alphabet to be inferred: another example of the
kind of circularity, or mutual dependence, of sub-abilities in
an intelligent system.

<h3><b>
<i>
9.10. Style and other global features
</i>
</b></h3>
Knowledge of 'picture styles' can also play an important role
in the process of perception and interpretation. Variations in
style include such things as whether the letters are all of the
same height and orientation, whether the bars are all of the
same width, whether the letters in words tend to be jumbled,
or overlapping, or at stepped heights, and so on. Notice that
some of these stylistic concepts depend on quite complex
geometrical relationships (for instance, what does 'jumbled'
mean?). If the program can take note of clues to the style of
a particular picture, during its analysis, this can help with
subsequent decisions about linking or interpreting fragments.
If you know the sizes of letters, for instance, then you can
more easily decide whether a line segment has a bit missing.
<p>
Hypotheses about style must, of course, be used with
caution, since individual parts of a picture need not conform
to the overall style. Local picture evidence can over-ride
global strategies based on the inferred style  provided that
the program can operate in a mode in which it watches out
for evidence conflicting with some of its general current
assumptions, using monitors of the sorts described in
<a href="#chap6">Chapter 6.</a>
</p><p>
</p>
<a name="9.11."></a>
<h3><b>
<i>
9.11. Perception involves multiple co-operating processes
</i>
</b></h3>
Our program includes mechanisms which make it possible to
set a number of different processes going in parallel, for
example, some collecting global statistics about the current
picture, some sampling the picture for dot-configurations
which might represent fragments of lines, others keeping track
of junctions between lines, or attempting to interpret parallel
segments as bars, some trying to interpret bars as strokes of
letters, and so on.
<p>
This parallelism is required partly because, with a large
amount of information available for analysis and
interpretation, it may not be easy to decide what to do next, for
example, which configurations to look for in the picture, and
where to look for them. Deciding between such alternatives
itself requires analysis and interpretation of evidence and at
first it will not be obvious where the important clues are, nor
what they are. So initially many on-going processes are
allowed to coexist, until items both unambiguous and
relatively important emerge, such as a long line, an unambiguous
clue to the location of a bar, some aspect of the style, or a set
of linked bar fragments which uniquely identify a letter.
</p><p>
When fragments forming clear-cut cues emerge, they can
invoke a 'higher-level' schema which takes control of
processing for a while, interrupting the 'blind' searching for
evidence,
by directing attention to suitable parts of the picture and
relevant questions.
</p><p>
If higher level processes form a plausible hypothesis, this
may suppress further analysis of details by lower level
processes. For instance, recognition of fragments of 'E', or 'X',
and of "I", where there appear to be only about four letters,
might cause a program (or person) to jump to the conclusion
that the word is 'EXIT', and if this fits into the context,
further examination of lines to check out on remaining strokes
of letters, and the missing 1', might then be abandoned. This
ability to jump to conclusions on the basis of partial analysis
may be essential to coping with a rapidly changing world.
However it depends on the existence of a fair amount of
redundancy in the sensory data: that is, it assumes a relatively
'friendly' (in the sense defined previously) world. It also requires an
architecture able to support multiple concurrent processes and the
ability for some of them to be aborted by others when their activities
are no longer needed.
</p><p>
This type of programming involves viewing perception as
the outcome of very large numbers of interacting processes of
analysis, comparison, synthesis, interpretation, and
hypothesis-testing, most, if not all, unconscious. On this view the
introspective certainty that perception and recognition are 'direct',
'unmediated' and involve no analysis, is merely a delusion.
(This point is elaborated in the papers by Weir -- see Bibliography.)
</p><p>
This schizophrenic view of the human mind raises in a new context the old
problem: what do we mean by saying that consciousness is 'unitary' or that a
person has one mind? The computational approach to this problem is to ask: how
can processes be so related that all the myriad sub-tasks may be sensibly
co-ordinated under the control of a single goal, for instance the goal of
finding the word in a spotty picture, or a robot's goal of using sensory
information from a camera to guide it as it walks across a room to pick up a
spanner? See also <a href="#chap6">Chapter 6</a> and <a href="#chap10">Chapter 10</a>.

<b>[[Note added 2001:</b>
<br>
At the time the program was being developed, we had some difficulty
communicating our ideas about the importance of parallel processing
concerned with different domains because AI researchers tended to assume
we were merely repeating
the well-known points made in the early 1970s
by Winograd, Guzman and others in the MIT AI Lab,
about "heterarchic" as opposed to "hierarchic" processing.
<br>
Heterarchic systems, dealt, as ours did, with
different domains of structures and relations between them (e.g.
Winograd's PhD thesis dealt with morphology, syntax, semantics and a
domain of three dimensional objects on a table).
<br>
Both models involve
mixtures of data-driven (bottom-up) and hypothesis-driven (top-down)
processes.
<br>
Both allow interleaving of processes dealing with the
different domains -- unlike <i>hierarchic</i> or <i>pass-oriented</i>
mechanisms
which first attempt to complete processing in one domain then pass the
results to mechanisms dealing with another domain, as in a processing
pipeline.
<p>
The main differences between heterarchy and our model were as follows:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>In an implementation of "heterarchic" processing there is
typically only <i>one</i> locus of control at any time. Thus processing
might be going on in a low level sub-system or in a high  level
sub-system, but not both in parallel with information flowing between
them.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>In those systems decisions to transfer control between sub-systems
were all taken explicitly by processes that decided they needed
information from another system: e.g. a syntactic analyser could decide
to invoke a semantic procedure to help with syntactic disambiguation,
and a semantic procedure could invoke a syntactic analyser to suggest
alternative parses.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>In that sort of heterarchic system it is not possible for a
process working in D1 to be <i>interrupted</i> by the arrival of new
information relevant to the current sub-task, derived from processing in
D2.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>Consequently, if a process in that sort heterarchic system
gets stuck in a blind-alley and does not notice this fact it may remain
stuck forever.
</li></ol>
The POPEYE architecture was designed to overcome these restrictions by
allowing processing to occur concurrently in different domains with
priority mechanisms in different domains determining which sub-processes
could dominate scarce resources. Priorities could change, and attention
within a domain could therefore be switched, as a result of arrival of
new information that was not explicitly asked for.
<br>
In this respect the POPEYE architecture had something in common with
neural networks in which information flows between concurrently
processing sub-systems
(usually with simulated concurrency).
Indeed, a neural net with suitable
symbol-manipulating sub-systems could be used to implement something
like the POPEYE architecture, though we never attempted to do this for
the whole system. After this chapter was written, work was done on
implementing the top level word-recognizer in POPEYE as a neural net to
which the partial results from lower level systems could be fed as they
became available.

<h3><b>
<i>
9.12. The relevance to human perception
</i>
</b></h3>
The world of our program is <i>very</i> simple. There are no curves,
no real depth, no movement, no forces. The program cannot
act in this world, nor does it perceive other agents. Yet even
for very simple worlds, a computer vision program requires
a large and complex collection of knowledge and abilities.
From such attempts to give computers even fragmentary
human abilities we can begin to grasp the enormity of the
task of describing and explaining the processes involved in
<i>real</i> human perception. Galileo's relationship to the physics
of the 1970s may be an appropriate and humbling comparison.
<p>
In the light of this new appreciation of the extent of our
ignorance about perceptual processes, we can see that much
philosophical discussion hitherto, in epistemology, philosophy
of mind, and aesthetics, has been based on enormous
over-simplifications. With hindsight much of what philosophers
have written about perception seems shallow and lacking in
explanatory power. But perhaps it was a necessary part of the
process of cultural evolution which led us to our present
standpoint.
</p><p>
Another consequence of delving into attempts to give
computers even very simple abilities is that one acquires enormous
respect for the achievements of very young children, many
other animals, and even insects. How does a bee manage to
land on a flower without crashing into it?
</p><p>
Many different aspects of perception are being investigated
in artificial intelligence laboratories. Programs are being
written or have been written which analyse and interpret the
following sorts of pictures or images, which people cope with
easily.
</p><p>
</p><ol type="a">
<li>Cartoon drawings.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>Line drawings of three dimensional scenes containing
objects with straight edges, like blocks and pyramids.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>Photographs or television input from three-dimensional
scenes, including pictures of curved objects.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>Stereo pairs from which fairly accurate depth
information can be obtained.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>Sequences of pictures representing moving objects, or
even television input showing moving objects.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>Satellite photographs, which give geological,
meteorological, or military information. (Unfortunately, some
people are unable to procure research funds unless they
pretend that their work is useful for military purposes
and, even more unfortunately, it sometimes is.)
<p></p>
</li>
<li>Pictures which represent 'impossible objects', like
Escher's drawings. Like people, a program may be able
to detect the impossibility (see Clowes, 1971, Huffman,
1971, and Draper (to appear)).
</li></ol>
<p>
Some of the programs are in systems which control the
actions of artificial arms, or the movements of vehicles. The
best way to keep up with this work is to read journal articles,
conference reports, and privately circulated departmental
reports. Text-books rapidly grow out of date. (This would
not be so much of a problem if we all communicated via a
network of computers and dispensed with books! But that
will not come for some time.)
</p><p>
Each of the programs tackles only a tiny fragment of what
people and animals can do. For example, the more complex
the world the program deals with the less of its visible
structure is perceived and used by the program. The POPEYE
program deals with a very simple world because we wanted it to
have a fairly full grasp of its structure (though even that is
proving harder than we anticipated). One of the major
obstacles to progress at present is the small number of
memory locations existing computers contain, compared with the
human brain. But a more important obstacle is the difficulty
of articulating and codifying all the different kinds of
structural and procedural knowledge required for effective visual
perception. There is no reason to assume that these obstacles
are insuperable in principle, though it is important not to
make extravagant claims about work done so far. For
example, I do not believe that the progress of computer vision
work by the end of this century will be adequate for the
design of domestic robots, able to do household chores like
washing dishes, changing nappies on babies, mopping up spilt
milk, etc. So, for some time to come we shall be dependent
on simpler, much more specialised machines.

<h3><b>
<i>
9.13. Limitations of such models
</i>
</b></h3>
It would be very rash to claim that POPEYE, or any other
existing artificial intelligence program, should be taken seriously
as a theory explaining human abilities. The reasons for saying
that existing computer models cannot be accepted as
explaining how people do things include:
<p>
</p><ol type="a">
<li>People perform the tasks in a manner which is far more
sensitive to context, including ulterior motives,
emotional states, degree of interest, physical exhaustion,
and social interactions. Context may affect detailed
strategies employed, number of errors made, kinds of
errors made, speed of performance, etc.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>People are much more flexible and imaginative in coping
with difficulties produced by novel combinations, noise,
distortions, missing fragments, etc., and better at noticing short
cuts and unexpected solutions to sub-problems.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>People learn much more from their experiences.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>People can use each individual ability for a wider variety
of purposes: for instance we can use our ability to
perceive the structure in a picture like Figure 1 to answer
questions about spaces between the letters, to visualise
the effects of possible movements, to colour in the
letters with different paints, or to make cardboard
cut-out copies. We can also interpret the dots in ways which
have nothing to do with letters, for instance seeing them
as depicting a road map.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>More generally, the mental processes in people are put
to a very wide range of <i>practical</i> uses, including
negotiating the physical world, interacting with other individuals,
and fitting into a society. No existing program or robot
comes anywhere near matching this.
</li></ol>
<p>
These discrepancies are not directly attributable to the
fact that computers are not made of neurons, or that they
function in an essentially serial or digital fashion, or that
they do not have biological origins. Rather they arise mainly
from huge differences in the amount and organisation of
practical and theoretical knowledge, and the presence in
people of a whole variety of computational processes to do
with motives and emotions which have so far hardly been
explored.
</p><p>
A favourite game among philosophers and some
'humanistic' psychologists is to list things computers cannot do. (See
the book by Dreyfus for a splendid example.) However, any
sensible worker in artificial intelligence will also spend a
significant amount of time listing things computers cannot
do  yet! The difference is that the one is expressing a
prejudice about the limitations of computers, whereas the other
(although equally prejudiced in the other direction, perhaps)
is doing something more constructive: trying to find out
exactly what it is about existing programs that prevents them
doing such things, with a view to trying to extend and
improve them. This is more constructive because it leads
to advances in computing, and it also leads to a deeper
analysis of the human and animal abilities under
investigation.
</p><p>
As suggested previously in <a href="#chap5">Chapter 5</a>, attempting to
<i>prove</i> that computers cannot do this or that is a pointless
exercise since the range of abilities of computers,
programming languages and programs is constantly being extended,
and nobody has any formal characterisation of the nature of
that process which could serve as a basis for establishing its
limits. The incompleteness and unsolvability theorems of
Goedel and others refer only to limitations of narrowly
restricted <i>closed</i> systems, which are quite unlike both people
and
artificial intelligence programs which communicate with the
world.
</p><p>
This chapter has presented a few fragments from the large
and growing collection of ideas and problems arising out of
A.I. work on vision. I have begun to indicate some of the
connections with philosophical issues, but there is a lot more
to be said. The next.chapter develops some of the points of
contact at greater length.

(1) The name 'POPEYE' comes from the fact that the program is written
in POP-2, a programming language developed at Edinburgh University
for artificial intelligence research. See Burstall <i>et al.</i> A full
account of
how POPEYE works, with an analysis of the design problems could fill
a small book.
This chapter gives a superficial outline, focusing on aspects that are
relevant to a general class of visual systems.
Details will be
published later. The work is being done with David Owen, Geoffrey
Hinton,
and Frank O'Gorman. Paul (1976) reports some closely related work.

The 1978 version of this book did not make it clear that the POPEYE program
was able to cope with pictures similar to <a href="#fig9.1">Figure 9.1</a>
but with additional positive and negative noise added, as illustrated in

A consequence of the parallelism and the bi-directionality of information flow
was that the program could often conclude that the word, or some higher level
structure, had been identified before all processing of the evidence had been
completed. Sometimes that identification was mistaken e.g. because the addition
of positive and negative noise, or overlap of letters, had obscured some of the
evidence, and further processing would reveal the error. This seems to reflect
the fact that humans sometimes think they have recognized someone or something
(and may then greet the person) and soon after that realise, with the person out
of sight, that the recognition was mistaken, presumably because more of the
links relating data and interpretation fragments have been computed. This
familiar feature of human vision, and related errors of proof-reading text, were
among the motivations for the design of Popeye.

<div style="margin-left:20px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">
[[<b>Notes added Sept 2001.</b>
<br>
<small>
(a) A more complete description of Popeye was never published and the
application for a research grant to extend the project around 1978 was
unsuccessful. Both appear in part to have been a consequence of the view
then gaining currency, based largely on the work of David Marr, that
AI vision researchers who concentrated on mixtures of top-down and
bottom-up processes were deluded, usually because they were misled by
problems arising from the use of <i>artificial</i>
images.
</p><p>
Marr's ideas about mistakes in AI vision research were originally
published in MIT technical reports that were widely circulated in the
mid 1970s. He died, tragically, in 1981, and the following year his
<i>magnum opus</i> was published:
D. Marr, <i>Vision</i>, 1982, Freeman, 1982.
</p><p>
(b) Marr's criticism of AI vision research was based in part on the
claim that natural images are far richer in information and if only
visual systems took account of that information they would not need such
sophisticated bi-directional processing architectures. My own riposte
at the time (also made by some other researchers) was:
</p>
<ul>
<li> On the one hand human vision can cope very well with these artificial and
degraded images, e.g. in cartoon drawings, and images like the
<a href="#fig9-a">"Noisy"</a> image above, so there is a fact to be
explained and modelled. Moreover that ability to deal effortlessly with cartoon
drawings may have some deep connection with intermediate stages of processing in
natural perception.
</li>
<li> In addition even natural images are often seriously degraded -- by
poor light, dirty windows, mist, dust-storms, occluding foliage, rapid
motion, other features of the environment, and damage to eyes.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
(c) In the late 1970s there was also growing support for a view also
inspired in part by Marr's work, namely, that symbol manipulating
mechanisms and processes  of the sorts described in this chapter and
elsewhere in this book were not really necessary, as everything could be
achieved by emergent features of collections of 'local cooperating
processes' such as neural nets.
</p><p>
Neural nets became increasingly popular in the following years, and they
have had many successful applications, though it is not clear that their
achievements have matched the expectations of their proponents. Work on
neural nets and other learning or self-organising systems, including the
more recent work on evolutionary computation, is often (though not
always) driven by a desire to avoid the need to understand a problem and
design a solution: the hope is that some <i>automatic</i> method will
make the labour unnecessary. My own experience suggests that until
people have actually solved some of these problems themselves they will
not know what sort of learning mechanism or self-organising system is
capable of solving them. However, when we have done the analysis
required to design the appropriate specialised learning mechanisms
we may nevertheless find that the products of such mechanisms are beyond
our comprehension. E.g., the visual ontology induced by a self-organising
perceptual system that we have designed may be incomprehensible to us.
</p>
<p>
What I am criticising is not the search for learning systems, or
self-organising systems, but the search for <i>general-purpose</i>
automatic learning mechanisms equally applicable to all sorts of
problems. What a human is able to learn depends on age and what
has been learnt previously. This suggests that
different domains require different sorts of learning
processes, e.g. learning to walk, learning to see, learning to read
text, learning to read music, learning to talk, learning a first
language, learning a formal, artificial language, learning arithmetic, learning
meta-mathematics, learning quantum mechanics, learning to play the
violin, learning to do ballet, etc.
</p>
<p>
In some cases the learning requires a specific <i>architecture</i> to be set up
within which the learning can occur. In some cases specific forms of
representation are required, and mechanisms for manipulating them. In some cases
specific forms of interaction with the environment are required for checking out
partial learning and driving further learning. And so on. Similar ideas can be
found in Annette Karmiloff-Smith's 1992 book <i>Beyond Modularity</i>, discussed
here:
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/beyond-modularity.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/beyond-modularity.html</a>

</p>
<p>
(d) At the time when the Popeye project was cancelled for lack of funds,
work was in progress to add a neural net-like subsystem to help with the
higher levels of recognition in our pictures of jumbled letters. I.e.
after several layers of interpretation had been operating on an image
like Figure 1, a hypothesis might begin to emerge concerning the letter
sequence in the second domain from the top. In the original Popeye
program a technique analogous to spelling correction was used to find
likely candidates and order them, which could, in turn, trigger top-down
influences to check out specific ambiguities or look for confirming
evidence. This spelling checker mechanism was replaced by a neural net
which could be trained on a collection of known words and then take a
half-baked letter sequence and suggest the most likely word. (This work
was done by Geoffrey Hinton, who was then a member of the Popeye
project, and later went on to be one of the leaders in the field of
neural nets.)
</p>
<p>
(e) Despite the excellence of much of Marr's research (e.g. on the
cerebellum) I believe that AI research on vision was dealt a
serious body blow by the publication of his views, along with the
fast growing popularity of neural nets designed to work independently of
more conventional AI mechanisms, and likewise later work on statistical
or self-organising systems, motivated in part by the vain hope that by
writing programs that learn for themselves or evolve automatically, we
can avoid the need to understand, design and implement complex visual
architectures like those produced by millions of years of evolution.
</p>
<p>
Certainly no matter what kinds of high level percept a multi-layer
interpretation system of the sort described in this chapter produces,
it is possible to mimic some of its behaviour by using probabilistic or
statistical mechanism to discover correlations between low level input
configurations and the high level descriptions. This is particularly
easy where the scenes involve isolated objects, or very few objects,
with not much variation in the arrangements of objects, and little or no
occlusion of one object by another.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that in real life, including many practical applications,
input images very often depict cluttered scenes with a wide variety of
possible objects in a wide variety of possible configurations. If the
image projection and interpretation process involves several
intermediate layers, as in figure 6 above, each with a rich variety of
permitted structures, and complex structural relations between the
layers, the combinatorics of the mapping between input images and high
level percepts can become completely intractable, especially if motion
is also allowed and some objects are flexible. One way of achieving
tractability is to decompose the problem into tractable sub-problems
whose solutions can interact possibly aided by background knowledge.
This seems to me to require going back to some of the approaches to
vision that were being pursued in the 1970s including approaches
involving the construction and analysis of <i>structural
descriptions</i> of intermediate configurations. The computer power
available for this research in the 1970s was a major factor in limiting
success of that approach: if it takes 20 minutes simply to find the
edges in an image of a cup and saucer there are strong pressures to find
short cuts, even if they don't generalise.
</p>
<p>
(f) The growing concern in the late 1970s and early 1980s for
<i>efficiency</i>, discouraged the use of powerful AI
programming languages like Lisp and Pop-11, and encouraged the use of
lower level batch-compiled languages like Pascal and C and later C++.
These languages were not as good as AI languages for expressing
complex operations involving structural descriptions, pattern matching
and searching, especially without automatic garbage collection
facilities. They are also not nearly as flexible in permitting
task-specific syntactic extensions as AI languages, which allow the
features of different problems to be expressed in different formalisms
within the same larger program. Moreover AI languages with interpreters
or incremental compilers provide far better support for
interactive exploration of complex domains where the algorithms and
representations required cannot be specified in advance of the
programming effort, and where obscure conceptual bugs often require
interactive exploration of a running system.
</p>
<p>
However, the emphasis on <i>efficiency</i> and <i>portability</i>
pressurised researchers to use the non-AI languages, and this subtly
pushed them into focusing on problems that their tools could handle.
</p>
<p>
Robin Popplestone (the original inventor of Pop2) once
said to me that he thought the rise in popularity of C had
killed off research in the real problems of vision. That may be a slight
exaggeration.
</p>
<p>
(g) For a counter example to the above developments see Shimon Ullman,
<i>High-level vision: Object recognition and visual cognition,</i>
MIT Press, 1996. I have the impression that there may now be a growing
collection of AI vision researchers who are dissatisfied with the narrow
focus and limited applicability of many machine vision projects, and
would welcome a move back to the more ambitious earlier projects,
building on what has been learnt in recent years where appropriate. This
impression was reinforced by comments made to me by several
researchers at the September 2001 conference of the
<a href="http://www.bmvc2001.man.ac.uk/">British Machine Vision Association.</a>
</p>
<p>
(h) Besides the obvious limitations due to use of artificially generated
images with only binary pixel values, there were many serious
limitations in the Popeye project, including the restriction to objects
with straight edges, the lack of any motion
perception, and the lack of any perception of 3-D structure and
relationships (apart from the partial depth ordering in the 2-D lamina
domain). Our defence against the criticism of over-simplification was
that we thought some of the architectural issues relevant to processing
more complex images or image sequences, dealing with more complex
environments, could usefully be addressed in an exploration of our
artificial domain, if only by producing a "proof of principle",
demonstrating how cooperative processes dealing with different domains
could cooperate to produce an interpretation without time-consuming
search.
</p>
<p>
(i) In the 20 years following the Popeye project (and this book) I
gradually became aware of more serious, flaws, as follows.
</p>
<div style="margin-left:-25px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px;">
<ul>
<li>I had assumed that although seeing involved processing structures in
different domains in parallel, it was necessarily a unitary process in
that all those processes contributed to the same eventual high level
task of acquiring information about the structure and contents of the
environment. Later it became clear that this was a mistake:
there are different architectural layers using visual information in
parallel for quite different purposes, e.g. posture control, planning
ahead of actions to be performed, fine-control of current actions
through feedback loops, answering questions about how something works,
social perception, and so on. The different sub-mechanisms require
different information about the environment, which they can acquire in
parallel, often sharing the same low level sensors.
<p>
Some of these are evolutionarily very old mechanisms shared with many
animals. Others use much newer architectural layers, and possibly
functions and mechanisms unique to humans.
</p>
<p>
This point was already implicit in my discussion of the overall architecture
with its multiple functions in <a href="#chap6">Chapter 6</a>, e.g. in
connection with monitors.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>At that time I shared the general view of AI researchers and many
psychologists that the primary function of perception, including vision,
was to provide information about the environment in the form of some
sort of "declarative" <i>description</i> or <i>information structure</i>
that could be used in different ways in different contexts. Later I
realised that another major function of perceptual systems
was to trigger appropriate <i>actions</i> directly, in response to
detected patterns.
<p>
Some of these responses were external and some internal, e.g. blinking,
saccadic eye movements, posture control, and some internal
emotional changes such apprehension, sexual interest, curiosity, etc.
</p>
<p>
This use of perceptual systems seems to be important both in innate
reflexes and in many learnt skills for instance athletic skills.
</p>
<p>Of course, when I started work on this project I already knew about
reflexes and trained high speed responses, as did everyone else: I
simply did not see their significance for a visual architecture
(though I had read J.J.Gibson's book
<i>The senses considered as perceptual systems</i>, which made the
point.)
</p>
<p>Later this idea became central to development of the theory about a
multi-layer architecture, mentioned above, in which reactive and deliberative
processes run in parallel often starting from the same sensory input. This theme
was developed in more detail in papers in the Birmingham <a
href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/">Cogaff (Cognition and Affect)
project</a>. This was originally entitled the Attention and Affect project set
up by
<a href="http://88.202.227.92/~glyn/">Glyn Humphreys</a>
and Aaron Sloman, when the latter moved from Sussex University to Birmingham in
1991. The project was later renamed as we acquired a deeper understanding of the
relationships between cognition and affect (e.g. how emotions, moods, desires,
etc., interact with control of many aspects of cognition including vision). None
of that was foreseen in the POPEYE project.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>Like many researchers on vision in AI and psychology, I had
assumed that insofar as vision provided factual information about the
environment it was information about <i>what exists</i> in the
environment. Later I realised that what is equally or more important, is
<i>awareness of what <i>might exist</i>, and the constraints</i> on what
might exist, e.g. "that lever can rotate about that point, though the
rotation will be stopped after about 60 degrees when the lever hits
the edge of the frame".
<p>
The need to see what is and is not possible, in addition to what is
actually there, has profound implications for the types of information
representation used within the visual system: structural descriptions
will not suffice. Several papers on this are included in the Cogaff web
site, some mentioned below. An example is this discussion of perception of
impossibilities added in 2015:
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/impossible.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/misc/impossible.html</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
The last critique was inspired by J.J.Gibson's notion of "affordance". See for
example his book, <i>The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception</i> originally
published in 1979. Although I rejected some of his theories (e.g. the theory
that perception could somehow be <i>direct</i>, and <i>representation free</i>),
the theory that vision was very often used for detecting affordances seemed very
important. I.e. much of what vision (and perception in general) is about is not
just provision of information about what is <i>actually</i> in the environment,
but, more importantly, information about what sorts of things are
<i>possible</i> in a particular environment that might be useful or harmful to
the viewer, and what the <i>constraints</i> on such possibilities are.
</p>
<p>
Although I think very little progress has been made on this topic,
several of my papers explored aspects of this idea, e.g.

During work on the CoSy robotic project in 2005 I became increasingly
aware that in addition to concurrent perception of <i>structures</i> at
different levels of abstraction a human-like (or intelligent robot's)
vision system would need to perceive <i>processes</i> of different
sorts, and different levels of abstraction concurrently, as explained in
this PDF presentation:

<h3><b>
<I>
10.1. Introduction
</I>
</b></h3>
<a href="#chap3">Chapter 3</a> included a long list of philosophical questions
of the form 'How is X possible?' Patient readers will find many points of
contact between those questions and the topics of the last few chapters,
especially the sort of work in computer vision described in <a
href="#chap9">Chapter 9.</a> In this chapter I shall comment
further, in a necessarily sketchy, shallow and speculative
fashion, on some of the connections between philosophy and
recent steps towards the design of a mind. Much of the
discussion is speculative because I shall be talking about types of
computing system whose complexity exceeds anything so
far programmed. But work already done in A.I. points clearly
in the directions I assume to be feasible.
<p>
Not all the philosophical problems I shall be referring to
are of the form 'How is X possible?' But the first one is:
namely how is it possible for there to be a distinction between
conscious and unconscious mental processes' Alternatively,
how is it possible for some, but not all, of the contents of
our minds to enter into our conscious experience? This topic
will be discussed at some length, after which a collection of
loosely related problems will be touched on.
<p>
<a name="10.2."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
10.2. Problems about the nature of experience and consciousness
</I>
</b></h3>
'What is consciousness?' is a very tricky question, for several
reasons. A full analysis of what we ordinarily understand by
the words 'conscious', 'consciousness', and related expressions,
such as 'awareness', 'self consciousness', 'experience', and the
like, would show that they are very complex and subtle. Such
an analysis, using the sorts of techniques outlined in
<a href="#chap4">Chapter four,</a>
should, ideally precede an attempt to provide some sort
of scientific explanation of phenomena involving consciousness.
<p>
I shall not go into such a detailed analysis now. But I want
to say something -- not about the most general sense of the
word 'conscious', which includes usages like 'I've been
conscious for several months that I am likely to lose my job soon',
which refers to some knowledge or belief -- but about the
kind of distinction we make between things that we are
currently conscious of and things we are not, especially things in
our own minds. I want to try to relate this distinction to
some computational considerations.
<p>
It is obvious that besides conscious mental processes there
are unconscious or subconscious ones, such as the decisions
about gear changes, steering and so on taken by an
experienced car driver, the recognition of syntactic structure in
understanding spoken and written language, and the detailed
analysis and interpretation processes involved in perceiving a
complex scene or picture. (Chapter 9.)
Moreover, what a learner is painfully conscious of may later be handled
unconsciously -- like gear-changing while driving a car, or
using grammatical constructs in a second language. So there need be no
difference in the <I>content</I> of conscious and unconscious processes.
<p>
Although it is obvious that there is a difference, it is
very difficult
to analyse this difference between what we are and are not
conscious of, especially as there are so many borderline cases
-- like finding something odd without being aware of what is
odd about it. Were you previously <i>conscious</i> of the fact that
you were reading print arranged in horizontal lines  or was
it unconsciously taken for granted? How is this different from
being conscious of the lines of print? Is a sleep-walker who
clearly opens a door in order to go through, conscious of the
door and aware that it is shut? Is he conscious that he is
opening it? While reading a gripping story you may be very
conscious of what is going on in the story, but hardly aware
of what is on the page. A good quick reader is conscious of
some of what is on the page, but not necessarily all the letters
composing words he reads. And he may be too engrossed in
what he is reading to be conscious of <i>the fact</i> that he is
reading.
<p>
For the past few minutes you have probably been conscious
of the fact that you were reading, but were you also conscious
of being conscious of it? And were you conscious of that too?
How far are you prepared to go in saying that you are
conscious of being conscious of being conscious of . . . etc.?
<p>
That was merely a reminder that what may at first seem to
be a clear and obvious distinction is often very slippery when
looked at closely  a typical philosopher's delight! Do not be
misled by rhetorical invitations to grasp the essence of
consciousness, or experience, or mind, by examining your own
current awareness. Introspection is not as easy or informative
as some think!
<p>
But there is a distinction, however slippery it may be. So
we can ask questions like: what is it for? How does it come
about that we are conscious of some of our mental states and
processes, but not others? What is special about the former?
Would we have any need to build in such a distinction if we
were designing a person, or an intelligent robot? What are the
preconditions for such a distinction to arise in a complex
information-processing system?
<p>
If, as suggested in <a href="#chap6">Chapter 6</a>, we can make a distinction
between relatively central administrative processes and the rest, then perhaps
we can use this as a basis for analysing the distinction between what the system
is conscious of and what it is not, roughly as follows:


<blockquote>
What the system is currently conscious of includes all the information
available to the central decision-making processes, whether or not
decisions are actually influenced as a result.
The system would be <i>self-conscious</i> to the extent that the
information available to these processes included information about
the system itself,  e.g. information about its location, its current
actions, its unfulfilled purposes, or even about what it is currently
conscious of! (Compare Minsky's 'Matter Mind and Models'.)
</blockquote>


Let us try to clarify this a little, recapitulating some points
from chapter 6. The central processes are those which, among
other things:
<ol type="a">
<li>choose between different motives, and control major
processes of deliberation and planning, like forming new
overall long-term aims and strategies,
<p>
<li>assign tasks and allocate resources to sub-processes,
<p>
<li>resolve conflicts between
different sub-processes (for instance if the desire for water
generates the intention to go in one direction whereas the desire to
avoid the tiger near the water-hole generates a desire to go in the
opposite direction)
<p>
<li>set up monitors to watch out for occurrences which
might be specially important in relation to current
activities,
<p>
<li>decide what to do about new information from
high-level monitors,
<p>
<li>in some systems they might also control the organisation
and cataloguing of major information stores used by
many different kinds of sub-processes.
</ol>
<p>
There would not be so great a need for any such centralised
process if there were not the possibility of conflicts. The body
cannot be in two places at once, the eyes cannot look in two
opposed directions at once, and there are limited
computational resources, so that expensive processes cannot
all run simultaneously (e.g. if one of the main information work-spaces
has a small capacity).
There might also be conflicts of a
more subtle sort, for example conflicts between different
ways of interpreting some information which is not at
present relevant to any on-going activity, but which <i>might</i> be.
In
all these cases, sub-processes will generate conflicting
goals, plans and strategies, and so there must be some means
of resolving the conflict, taking into account the needs of the
whole system (the need to avoid serious injury, the need for
food, the need for well-organised catalogues and information
stores, the need to go on collecting information which might
be useful sometime, the need to develop new abilities and
improve old ones, and so on).
<p>
The need for global decision-making processes would be
further reduced if the system were less flexible, that is, if it
were not possible to change the nature and aims of different
sub-processes. Where a complex system has a relatively fixed
structure, there will be no need for decisions about what the
structure should be!
<p>
What I have called 'central' processes need not be located centrally in a
physical sense: indeed, for reasons given in <a href="#chap5">chapter 5</a> and
elsewhere, they need not have <i>any</i> specific physical location. For
example, in a nation where all citizens vote on every major policy decision,
everybody is part of the central process.
<p>
Further, the central processes need not all be under the
control of some single program: the central administrator
may itself be simply a collection of sub-processes using certain
stores of information, but changing in character and strategy
from time to time, like the political party in power. Its
function in the total system is what defines the central process, or
collection of processes.
<p>
If lots of separate sub-systems could happily co-exist
without any conflicts, and without any need for or possibility of
a co-ordinated division of labour, then there would not be a
role for any kind of centralised decision-making. Alison Sloman
informs me that there are several kinds of organisms
which live together in co-operative colonies, but which do
not need the sort of global decision-making I am talking
about. Coral is an example. If, like most plants, such a colony
cannot move or has no control over its movements, or if
which way it moves does not matter, then there cannot be
conflicts about which way it should move. If a system does
not have eyes, then there cannot be conflicts or decisions
about which way it should look. This suggests that the
evolution of organisms with a distinction between conscious and
unconscious processes may be closely related to the evolution
of forms of symbiosis and co-operation in complex tasks, and
the differentiation of functions.
<p>
(This line of thought also suggests that it may be possible to make a
distinction between what a human social system is and is not
conscious of, if it is a relatively integrated system. Of course, we
must not expect the distinction to be any less blurred and slippery than
it is when applied to individual people.)
<p>
So, perhaps the distinction between what we are and are
not conscious of at a particular time, is concerned with the
difference between information which is made available to.
or used by, central administrative processes, and information
which is not. There will be many processes which continue
without any notice being taken of them by the central
administrator, and at each moment there is an enormous amount of
unused information present in stores of various kinds. There
is no point cluttering up the central decision-making with all
the details of the sub-processes: the task of relating all the
information would be too unmanageable. So censorship of a
sort is a prerequisite for normal functioning of such a system,
rather than an oddity to be explained. (This principle is
integral to the design of the POPEYE program described in
chapter 9.)
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>[[Note added Sept 2001:</b>
<br>
In the years following publication of this book many researchers have
attempted to avoid the need for any kind of central administrative
mechanism by postulating networks of cooperative
and competing mechanisms through which global decisions and behaviour
can emerge. Typically this requires the notion of some sort of common
<I>currency</I> in terms of which the relative importance of different
needs and goals and plans can be evaluated by local comparisons, and
possibly some sort of voting scheme for combining the preferences of
different components of the system.
<p>
Despite the popularity of such ideas I suspect they are appropriate only
to problems where there is no possibility of a well structured solution
based on a clear understanding of the different sub-goals, their
relationships, the options for action, the possibilities for compromise
or for optimal sequencing. Where attempts are made to base
decision-making entirely on numerical
computations, e.g. using probabilities and utilities, it often turns out
(in AI and in government procedures) that reliance only on numerical
processes loses much information, by comparison with descriptive
methods. A consequence is
that good solutions cannot be found except in simple cases.
<p>
The idea of a high level unitary decision-making process for resolving
conflicts on the basis of a global viewpoint is often re-invented.
E.g. See P.N. Johnson-Laird,
<I>The Computer and the Mind: An Introduction to Cognitive Science</I>,
1993 (2nd Edition). He draws an unfortunate analogy with operating
systems, unfortunate (a) because typically operating systems are
concerned with huge amounts of low level management in addition to the
more central global decision making, and (b) because an operating system
can often become subservient to a more intelligent program running
within the operating system, e.g. AI programs controlling a robot.
<b>]]</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is possible for perceptual sub-processes which do not
influence the central processes at all, to produce modifications
of the store of beliefs, and help to control the execution of
other sub-processes. They may even influence the <i>central</i>
processes at some later stage -- a possibility taken for granted by
advertisers and propagandists. This amounts to a form of
unconscious perception, differing from conscious perception
only in its relationship to the central processes. So from the
present viewpoint, the existence of unconscious mental
processes is in no way puzzling.
<p>
We can <i>become</i> conscious of some, but not all, of the
things in our minds of which we are not conscious. Much of
the information which is not accessed by central processes
<i>could be</i> if required. There are all sorts of things in your
memory, of which you are currently not conscious (though if
asked you might say you have been aware of them for several
years!), but which you could become conscious of if you
needed the information.
<p>
The same is true of much of the
information processed by our senses: you may become
conscious of the humming noise in the background which you
previously did not notice, because someone draws your
attention to it, or because it stops, or even because you simply
decide to listen to your surroundings. However, some things
are not accessible. Why not?
<p>
There are several different sorts
of reasons why information about a complex system may be
inaccessible to the central processes. Here are some, which
might not occur to someone not familiar with programming.
<p>
<div style="margin-left:-15px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">
<ol type="a">
<li>As already pointed out, many sub-processes will acquire,
use, or store information without any need to notify
central processes. They will use their own, private
work-spaces. If the information is not recorded in globally
accessible records, there may be no way the central processes can get
at the information, for instance information in peripheral
perceptual processes. The sub-processes may be incapable of being
modified so as to make them store information elsewhere, and it may not
be possible to give monitors access to their 'innards'. This is
especially likely
to be the case if the mechanisms are 'hard-wired' rather
than programmed. In a computer it is relatively (!) easy
to change the behaviour of programs, whereas changing
the behaviour of the underlying physical machine may be
impossible.
<p>
<li>When a program is executed in a computer, it may keep
records of some of its activities in examinable structures,
but not all of its activities. The records enable a computer
to answer questions about what it is doing or has done,
and, more importantly, enable it to do things more
intelligently, since different sub-tasks can be explicitly compared
with one another, so that learning and self-control can
occur. Storing explicit records of processes takes up space
and extra processing power, but it may provide much
greater flexibility, including the ability to learn from
mistakes. This is what happens in Sussman's Hacker system
when it executes 'in careful mode' the programs it has
designed (Sussman, 1975). So one source of
inaccessibility may be simply the fact that although a program
does things, it does not keep any records which may be
examined later, even a very short time later.
<p>
<li>Even if information is present in some store, it may not
be accessible until suitable entries have been made in
indexes or catalogues. So some facts about what is going
on in our minds may be recorded quite explicitly, yet
never indexed properly. This could prevent central
processes ever finding out about them.
<p>
<li>Whether information actually present is accessible or not
can also depend on peculiarities of the processes which
attempt to access them. Some processes may have a built
in assumption that all information relevant to them can
be found via a particular sub-catalogue. (Like people who
think that the only good books on philosophy are to be
found in the philosophy section of the library.) Hence
information may be inaccessible at certain times simply
because the searching is done in too inflexible a fashion.
Suitable forms of learning may improve the flexibility of
our information-accessing processes, making us more
conscious of what we are doing. (However, there will
usually be a price to pay for increased flexibility  such
as reduced speed: another trade-off.)
<p>
<li>Among the events which are not recorded explicitly,
some, but not all, can be readily recomputed from items
which are recorded. So, in some cases, inaccessibility may
be accounted for in terms of inadequate records being
kept, or inadequate inference procedures for
reconstructing what happened from available records.
<p>
<li>Some of the explicit records of what is going on may be
inaccessible because the need to refer to them has not
been recognised by the central process. Perhaps it failed
to set up appropriate monitors (<a href="#chap6">chapter 6</a>)
because of
poor procedures for the task in hand. For example, when
learning to play a musical instrument people often find it
very hard to learn to keep on listening to important
aspects of their own performance which they need to
hear to control their playing, even though they have no
difficulty in listening to someone else. Similarly, many
teachers fail to attend to the evident effects of their
behaviour on their pupils.
<p>
<li>People often react to cues by jumping to conclusions
about something, and thereafter fail to examine the
readily available evidence further to check whether the
conclusion is correct. Single-minded or simple-minded
programs may behave in the same way. And very often this is
a very sensible way to behave, if rapid decisions have to
be taken (see <a href="#chap9">Chapter 9</a>). However, if the strategy is firmly
embedded in a collection of procedures for interpreting
certain information, then some aspects of the information
may never be examined properly.
<p>
<li>The system may lack the descriptive and interpretative
abilities required for perceiving the significant
relationships between items of information which are readily
accessible. (Compare chapter 9, and remarks about
concepts in <a href="#chap2">Chapter 2.</a>) Suitable concepts, and training in
their use, may be required before important facts can be
noted. If you have never grasped the concept of symmetry
you cannot be conscious of the symmetry in a pattern.
Someone who has not learnt to think about the
difference between valid and invalid arguments cannot be
aware of the validity or invalidity of an argument. A child
who has not learnt to think about grammatical categories
cannot be aware that he is, or is not, matching the
number of a verb and its subject.
<p>
(I believe that much of what Marxists refer to as 'false
consciousness', like the inability of people to see themselves as
exploited,
can be accounted for in terms of a lack of some of the analytical
and interpretative concepts required. What needs to be explained,
then, is not why people are not conscious of such facts, but how
it is possible for them ever to learn the concepts which can make
them conscious.)
<p>
<li>Some processes may use a temporary work-space which is
not fully integrated with the enduring memory structures,
but instead gets re-used frequently. While information is
in this temporary store it may be as accessible as anything
else -- but if it is not accessed before the space is re-used it will be
permanently lost. So the reason the records are
inaccessible to the central processes may be that searches
are always carried out too late.
<p>
Much of what we do may
involve such rapidly re-used storage  so that if asked
about details shortly after doing things we cannot recall
exactly what happened. Perhaps the activities of a
sleep-walker who seems to be fully conscious while walking
about also use such temporary storage space for records
which would normally be linked to more enduring
structures. (None of this presupposes that there is any physical
difference between the permanent and the temporary
storage locations, nor in the mechanisms for accessing
them. It may even be possible for 'permanent' records to
be obliterated and the space re-claimed for temporary
storage! A lot depends on the storage medium, about
which very little is known in the case of humans.)
</ol>
</div>
<p>
What I have been driving at is that what is hardest to
explain is not why some things are inaccessible, but how
things ever become accessible to central processes. We do not
need to postulate mechanisms for preventing things becoming
conscious: mere <i>lack</i> of a mechanism, or activity, may explain
that. However there may be explicit suppression or
censorship too.
<p>
We have already seen that there is good reason for
arranging that only a subset of all goings-on be reported
centrally. So sub-processes may have explicit instructions about
what to report and what not to report. Moreover, it is necessary
for these instructions to be modifiable in the light of
current needs and expectations. So the central administrator
may have some control over what gets reported to it. Thus
there is plenty of scope for it to give explicit instructions
preventing certain categories of information being recorded, or
reported to globally accessible stores.
<p>
So some items may be
inaccessible as a direct result of policy decisions within the system
(as Freud suggested). Records of
these policy decisions may themselves be inaccessible! (Many
of these points will be quite obvious to administrators, both
corrupt and honest.) Further study of this topic should
illuminate various sorts of human phenomena, desirable and
undesirable.
<p>
I have already warned against the assumption that there is
necessarily a <i>unique</i> continuing process with the centralised
decision-making role. There might be a number of relatively
self-contained sub-processes which gain control at different
times. If they each have separate memory stores (as well as
having access to some shared memory), then we can expect
schizophrenic behaviour from the system. Perhaps this is the
normal state of a human being, so that, for example, different
kinds of central processes, with different skills, are in control
during sleeping and waking, or in different social settings.
<p>
Maybe only a subset of what constitutes a central
administrator changes during such switches, for instance, a subset of
the motivational store and a subset of the factual and
procedural memory. Then personality has only partial continuity.
<p>
It is possible (as I believe Leibniz claimed) that instead of
there being one division between what is and is not conscious
in a complex system, there may be many divisions  one for
the system as a whole, and more for various sub-systems. If
there is something in the argument about the need for some
centralised decision-making in the system as a whole, then the
same argument can be used for the more complex sub-systems:
considered as an organic whole, there may be some things a
sub-system can be said to be conscious of, and others which it cannot.
<p>
This would be clearest in a computer which controlled a
whole lot of robot-bodies with which it communicated by
radio. For each individual robot, there might be a fairly
well-integrated sub-system, aware of where the robot is, what is
going on around it, exactly what it is doing, and so on. Within
it there will be sub-processes and information-stores of which
it is not conscious, for the reasons already given (and no
doubt others). Similarly within the total system, composed
of many robots, there will be some kind of centralised
process which is not concerned with all the fiddly details of each
robot, but which knows roughly where each one is, knows
which tasks it is performing, and so on. It may be capable of
attending closely to the things an individual robot is looking
at, thinking about, feeling, etc., with or without its knowledge,
but will not do this all the time for all of them. So individual
robots may be aware of things the system as a whole cannot
be said to be aware of, and vice versa. Worse, the whole thing
might itself be only a part of a still more complex yet
centrally controlled system!
<p>
Maybe that is the best way to think of a person: but if so
we shall not fully understand why until our attempts to
design a working person have forced such organisations on us.
<p>
We need further analysis of the sorts of computational
problems which might lead to subdivisions of administrative
functions, and the reasons why the development of individual
systems might go wrong, leading to too many relatively
independent sub-systems, or to too little communication or shared
structure between them. Psychiatry and education might
hope to gain a great deal from such studies. Perhaps the same
is true also of political science.
<p>
We are at present nowhere near an adequate analysis of the
concept of conscious experience, and related concepts. But it
seems that in investigating the different forms of
self-awareness required by intelligent mechanisms we have a far
better chance of getting new insights than from the typical
style of philosophical discussion on this topic, which all too

10.3. Problems about the relationships between experience and behaviour
</I>
</b></h3>
In the course of analysing and interpreting a complex image a computer
may generate a very large number of sub-processes, and build up many
intricately interrelated symbolic structures. (See <a href="#chap6">Chapter 6</a>,
<a href="#chap8">Chapter 8</a> and <a href="#chap9">Chapter 9.</a>)
Although these processes and structures are
used temporarily in subsequent analyses, the organisation of the system
may make it quite impossible for the program to express in its
<i>output</i> anything more than a brief summary of the end product, for
example, 'I see a man, sitting at a table covered with books and
papers.' There may be several different reasons for such restrictions.
<p>
For instance the available output <i>medium</i> may be ill-suited
to represent the rich detail of the internal structures (as a
linear string of words is ill-suited to represent a complex
map-like network). Or the processes and structures may be set up
in such a way that output mechanisms cannot access them,
for any of the sorts of reasons mentioned in discussing
consciousness.
<p>
So crude behaviourist analyses of statements about the
detailed experiences of the computer must be rejected.
Experience, conscious and unconscious, in humans, animals
and machines, may be much richer than anything their
behaviour can reveal.
<p>
But even more subtle dispositional or behaviourist analyses
(in terms of how the behaviour <i>would have</i> been different if
the stimuli had been different, e.g. if probing questions had
been asked) may be inappropriate  for the program need
not allow for <i>any</i> behavioural indications of some of the fine
details of the internal analysis.
<p>
For example, a compiler which translates high-level
programs into machine code may be written in such a way, that
it is impossible (without major re-programming) to obtain a
print out of some of the structures temporarily created
during the translation process, for instance the temporarily
created 'control-structures'. After all, its main function is not to
print out records of its own behaviour, but to translate the
programs fed into it.
<p>
The situation is more complex with an operating system.
One of the tasks of an operating system may be to manage
the flow of information (inwards or outwards) between
sub-processes in the computer and various devices attached to it.
If it is required to print out details of how it is managing all
the traffic, then this adds to the traffic, thereby changing the
process it is attempting to report on. This sort of thing makes
it very difficult to check on the workings of an operating
system. But the main point for present purposes is that there are
computational systems which cannot produce external
behaviour indicating features of their internal operation without
thereby significantly altering their operation. There is no
reason to doubt that this is true of people and animals.
<p>
All this means that the scientific study of people and
animals has to be very indirect if they are computational
systems of the sort I have been discussing. In particular, the lack
of any close relation between inner processes and observable
behaviour means that theorising has to be largely a matter of
guesswork and speculation. The hope that the guesswork can
be removed by direct inspection of brains seems doomed.
You will not find out much about how a complex compiler
or operating system works by examining the 'innards' of the
computer, for they are programs, not physical mechanisms.
The only hope of making serious progress in trying to
understand such a system is to try to design one with similar
abilities.

``The only hope'' is too strong. Rather I should have written something
more like
``The only hope of making serious progress in trying to
understand such a system is to combine as many different empirical
investigations, of what individuals do, how they develop, how the

problems are that had to be solved, and in order to test partial

<h3><b>
<I>
10.4. Problems about the nature of science and scientific theories
</I>
</b></h3>
Computer models of visual perception are attempts to answer questions of
the form 'How is X possible?' for instance, 'How is it possible to
interpret an untidy collection of visual data as
representing such and such a scene?' and 'How is it possible
for locally ambiguous image fragments to generate a unique
global  interpretation?'.  So  they  provide  a  further illustration
of the claim in <a href="#chap2">chapter
2</a> that science is concerned with discovering and explaining
possibilities.
<p>
Moreover, although such models are rich in explanatory
power, since they can explain some of the fine structure of
visual abilities, they do not provided a basis for prediction.
This is because, like many explanations of abilities, or possibilities,
they do not specify conditions under which they will be invoked, nor do
they rule out the possibility of extraneous
processes interfering with them. So, how we use our visual
abilities (for example, what we notice, how we react to it
and how we describe our experiences to others), depends on
our desires, interests, hopes, fears, and on our other abilities,
rather than merely on what enables us to see.
(As Chomsky has often pointed out, competence is not a basis for
predicting actual performance.)
<p>
An explanatory program will have some limitations. There
will be some situations it cannot cope with, for example,
pictures which it interprets wrongly or not at all. Predictions
of human errors could be based on some of the errors made by the
program, and if similarities are discovered, that supports the
claim that the program provides a good explanation of the human
ability. However, people may use additional resources to
cope with the situations where the program goes wrong. For
example, some knowledge about the whereabouts of a person
may prevent your mistaking another person for her, whereas
a program using only visual similarity would go wrong. This
ability to recover from mistakes is to be expected if, as
explained in Chapters <a href="#chap6">6</a>, <a href="#chap8">8</a>
and <a href="#chap9">9,</a>
intelligent systems require
multiple ongoing processes, some of which
monitor the performance of others.
So even if it is true that a certain person
uses exactly the same strategy as some computer program, in
all the cases where the strategy is successful, there need not
be a close correspondence between the program's limitations
and the limitations of the person. Explanatory power, then,
is not necessarily bound up with predictive power, though it
does depend on generative power.
<p>
Similar remarks could be made about other sorts of A.I.
work. For instance, language-understanding and
problem-solving programs are rich in explanatory power in the sense
of being capable of generating a variety of detailed
behaviours. So they are good candidate explanations of how it is
possible for people to behave in those ways. Yet they do not
provide a basis for predicting when people will do things. So
they do not explain laws.
<p>
What this amounts to in computational terms, is that to
specify that a collection of procedures and information is
available to a system explains capabilities of the system, but
does not determine the conditions under which they are
invoked or modified by other procedures in the system. So
work in computer vision, like much else in A.I. and linguistics
research, supports the claim of <a href="#chap2">chapter 2</a>
that explanatory
power is related more closely to generative power than to
predictive power. Rival explanations of the same abilities
may be compared by comparing the variety and intricacy of
the problems they can cope with, and the variety of different
sorts of behaviour they can produce. When we begin to
develop programs which approximate more closely to human
competence, we shall have to use additional criteria, including
comparisons of implementation details, and of the underlying
machines presupposed.

<h3><b>
<I>
10.5. Problems about the role of prior knowledge in perception
</I>
</b></h3>
It is possible in principle for a system with little or no initial
knowledge somehow to be modified through a long period of
interaction with the environment so that it acquires
perceptual abilities. However, this sort of learning without
presuppositions can only be a relatively blind trial-and-error
process. The clearest example seems to be the evolution of
mechanisms like perceptual systems in animals. This process
of learning with minimal presuppositions apparently requires
millions of years and is quite unlike the learning achieved by
an individual animal after birth, which is much more rapid
and intelligent, especially in humans. So completely <i>general</i>
theories of learning, not related to knowledge about any
specific domain, and capable of explaining only the ability to
conduct huge, unguided searches through millions of
possibilities, are unlikely to have much relevance to human
learning, though they may usefully characterise some
evolutionary processes.
<p>
I am not claiming that we understand the evolution of intelligent
species. In particular, it is not obvious that the blind, trial-and-error
learning process continues beyond the earliest stages. A species (or
larger biological system) is a complex computational mechanism,
with distributed processing power, and as such it may be able, to
some extent, to direct its own development just as some species (e.g.
humans) already direct the evolution of others (e.g. breeding cattle).
(Some people have explicitly recommended generalising that to human
evolution.)
<p>
As Kant recognised, <i>intelligent</i> learning from experience
requires considerable prior domain-specific knowledge.
Chomsky (1965) makes this point about language-learning,
but it is clearly very much more general. This is borne out by
attempts to give computers visual abilities. All programs
which do anything like perceiving objects and learning about
the environment seem to require a rich body of implicit
theoretical and practical knowledge. The theoretical knowledge
concerns the possible structures of sensory data and the
possible forms of 'scenes' which can give rise to such experience.
<p>
The practical knowledge concerns ways of <i>using</i> the
theoretical knowledge to interpret what is given. Nobody has been
able to propose explanations of how an individual might
acquire all this knowledge from experience, without prior
knowledge to drive the analysis and interpretation of experience.
<p>
What we are beginning to learn from such artificial
intelligence research is the precise nature of the background
knowledge required for various forms of visual perception. For
instance, by designing working models we can explore such
questions as: what sorts of knowledge about the geometry
and topology of images does a visual system require? Which
sorts <i>of general</i> knowledge about space and <i>specific</i>
knowledge about particular sorts of objects can enable a rational
system to find the best global interpretation of a mass of
locally ambiguous evidence without wasting time exploring a
host of unsatisfactory possibilities? How much prior
knowledge of good methods of storing, indexing, and manipulating
information is required?
<p>
We also breathe new life into old philosophical and
psychological problems about the general categories required for
experiences of various sorts, or the sorts of concepts which
are grasped by infants. For example, the POPEYE program
samples the given image looking for dot-strips unambiguously
indicating a portion of a line. If two such fragments are
collinear, the program hypothesises that they belong to the same
line. Thus it uses the concept <i>of an object extended in space.</i>
Similarly if a program is to interpret a series of changing
images in terms of some sort of continuous experience (as in
Weir, 1974, 1977) then it requires the concept <i>of an
object enduring through time,</i> as Kant pointed out long ago.
<p>
These object concepts play an important role in organising
and indexing information so that it can be <i>used.</i> In order to
have integrated perceptual experiences one needs to make
use of concepts of objects which in some sense go beyond
what is given. The object-concepts are organising wholes with
explanatory power. (I am not claiming that these concepts
are necessarily used <i>consciously.</i> The relationships between
this and claims about object concepts made by Piaget and
other developmental psychologists remain to be explored. I
believe newborn infants are grossly underestimated in this as
in other respects.)
<p>
When better theories about the presuppositions of different
sorts of learning have been developed, we shall be in a much
better position to assess the rationality of the processes by
which knowledge can be derived from experience.
<p>
Philosophers' writings about the relation between knowledge and
perception normally ignore all the complexities which come
to light if one begins to design a working visual system. In
particular, it is usually taken for granted that the contents of
our sensory experiences, such as patches of colour, lines,
shapes, are somehow simply 'given', whereas work in A.I.
suggests that even these are the results of complex processes
of analysis and interpretation. So whereas philosophers tend
only to discuss the rationality of inferences drawn from what
appears to be given, we can now see that there is a need to
discuss the rationality of the processes by which what is given
emerges into consciousness. I have tried to suggest that this
emergence is the result of very complex, usually unconscious,
but nevertheless often rational, processes.

<a name="10.6."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
10.6. Problems about the nature of mathematical knowledge
</I>
</b></h3>
As explained in <a href="#chap9">Chapter 9,</a>
perceptual systems require a great deal of prior (usually implicit)
knowledge of the possible structure of their own experiences and
possible interpretations thereof. This is what distinguishes  a system
which analyses or interprets the sensory information it receives, from a
device, like a camera, or a  tape recorder, which passively records such
information.
<p>
What the prior knowledge is, and how it should be
represented in a usable form, are topics of current research. But it
seems to be settled beyond doubt that it includes a certain
amount of topology and geometry  not all of which can
have been acquired from perceptual experience, since it is
required for such experience (unless we count the evolution
of the human species as experience).
<p>
I am not suggesting that children are born with the
contents of mathematical text-books in their heads. Much of the
knowledge is probably in procedural rather than factual form,
and the set of initial concepts is likely to be different from
the set of primitives in a mathematical presentation. For
example, it is possible that the notion <i>of straight line</i>
develops only later on, from some kind of more general
notion of a line.
<p>
We are now faced with the possibility of new detailed
explorations into processes by which such a system might
become aware of the limits of possible forms of sense-data,
the limits of its own interpretation procedures, and the limits
on the forms of interpretation it is capable of generating. In
this way we may hope to discover new answers to the old
question: 'What is the nature of geometric knowledge?'
<p>
Already it seems clear that in concentrating on geometry,
Kant missed some deeper and more general forms of
knowledge concerned with topology, a branch of mathematics
which had not been developed at the time. Many other
Kantian questions can be reopened in this way, such as
questions about the nature of arithmetical knowledge, discussed
in <a href="#chap8">Chapter 8.</a>
<p>
Very little work has been done so far on ways of giving
computer programs the ability to discover their own abilities
and limitations. The most obvious method is to let a program
try all possible combinations of sub-procedures to see what
can and cannot be achieved. However, for complex systems
this requires astronomical or even infinite search spaces to be
explored, so that realistic programs must have more
intelligent methods of proving things about themselves.
Exploring this may one day teach us what mathematical intuition is.

<a name="10.7."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
10.7. Problems about aesthetic experience
</I>
</b></h3>
Philosophers concerned with the nature of art and aesthetic
experience require a theory of perception on which to build.
We have seen that from a computational viewpoint, even the
simplest forms of perception involve very complex but
tightly-interconnected internal processes, which are essentially
mental, not physiological, even though we may be largely unaware
of them. One way of summarising this is to say that sensory
input is like a complex computer program which activates all
sorts of different kinds of stored knowledge and abilities,
which then interact to generate a process of interpretation
which, in turn, may generate other processes, as described in
<a href="#chap6">Chapter 6</a> and
<a href="#chap9">Chapter 9</a>.
That is, we are programmed by whatever impinges
on us (see Davies and Isard, 1971). (Of course both people
and computers may retain some degree of autonomy in their
internal responses to such programming, just as a compiler or operating
system does.)
<p>
I suggest that aesthetic qualities of experiences are best
analysed in terms of the characteristics of these computational
processes. Very crudely, a poem, a picture, or tune is more
moving, the greater the variety and complexity of the
processes it programs. For instance, great music generates
processes concerned with auditory experiences, bodily movement,
emotional states and intellectual processes including matching
structures and resolving ambiguities (Longuet-Higgins, 1976).
<p>
Much art and music is shallow because it generates only
relatively simple processes or only a restricted range of processes.
By contrast, some is shallow because too confusing: the
perceptual processes are jammed and fail to activate deeper
processes. Occasionally this is because the perceiver needs to be
educated. The trade-offs between complexity and power in
art are very tricky.
<p>
Perhaps one day, in a descendant of the POPEYE program
described above, visual experiences will be capable of
activating not only stored specifications of general spatial concepts.
but also memories of individual past experiences, emotional
reactions, and other associations. Designing such systems will give
new insights into the process of being <i>moved</i> by an experience.
<p>
Here are a few further observations about perceptual
systems which seem to be relevant to aesthetic issues. Artificial
intelligence programs (unlike those in the 'pattern recognition'
paradigm) typically exhibit considerable <i>creativity</i> in
analysing pictures, understanding sentences, solving problems, etc.
<p>
This is because they usually have to work out novel ways of
combining their resources for each new task. A
picture-analysing program need not have seen a particular
configuration previously to be able to interpret it. Often the task of
interpreting a picture involves solving some problem (e.g.
<p>
Why is there a gap in this line? Which is the best combined
interpretation of a group of ambiguous fragments? What are
the people in the picture looking at?). We can distinguish
pictures according to how complex the problem-solving is,
how richly the different sub-processes interact, how many
different sorts of knowledge are used, how far it is possible to
avoid arbitrary assumptions in arriving at a global
interpretation, and so on. These computational distinctions seem to be
closely bound up with some aesthetic qualities of a picture,
poem or piece of music, often vaguely referred to as unity,
harmony, composition, etc. Another issue relevant to
aesthetics is the role of different sorts of representation in
computer vision systems. See section 10.8. for more on this.
<p>
The processes involved in art forms using language (poetry,
novels, drama, opera, etc.) are probably more complex and
varied than the processes related to painting, sculpture or
music. In particular, there is more scope for interaction with
huge amounts of knowledge of a whole culture. However, I
shall not discuss this topic further.

<h3><b>
<I>
10.8. Problems about kinds of representational systems
</I>
</b></h3>
There are several philosophical contexts in which questions
arise about the similarities and differences between different
forms of symbolism or representation  for example in
philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of science, philosophy of
language and philosophy of art. One of the most important
features of artificial intelligence research is the way in which
it has generated new sorts of explorations of different forms
of representation. In particular two mathematically
equivalent methods of representing some collection of information
may be quite different in computational power. (This is
illustrated in <a href="#chap8">the chapter on learning about numbers,</a>
and in the chapter on analogical representations, <a href="#chap7">Chapter 7.</a>
See also the papers on representations by Hayes, Bobrow and Woods.)
<p>
Work on computer vision has included explorations of
alternative methods of representation. In particular, although
for certain purposes propositional symbolisms are useful, it is
often essential that information be stored in structures which
to some extent mirror the structure of the image being
analysed, or the structure of the scene being depicted.
Without this it may be difficult to constrain searches when
combining fragments, or checking interpretations for consistency.
<p>
Thus programs which do not use analogical representations
may take far too long. For instance, a two dimensional array
of picture features is often used to reflect neighbourhood
relations in the image. Further, in analysing pictures with lots
of lines forming a network, it is common to build a network
in the computer, representing the topology of the image
network. If the image lines depict edges of three-dimensional
objects, the very same network can provide a structure from
which to start growing a three-dimensional interpretation.
Changing the form of representation could seriously affect the time
required for certain sorts of processing,
even if the same information is available.
<p>
Sometimes philosophers discussing the differences between different forms of
representation (e.g. Goodman, 1969) suggest that the ease with which we
interpret certain sorts of pictures is merely a matter of practice and
familiarity. The sort of analysis outlined in <a href="#chap7">chapter 7</a>
shows that this is a shallow explanation, missing the point that there may be
important differences in computational power involved. At any rate, all this
should undermine philosophical discussions of perception which presuppose that
all the knowledge (or beliefs) generated by perceptual experiences can be
thought of as propositional, so that questions about the logical validity of
inferences arise. For non-propositional representations, non-logical forms of
inference, may also be used. Which of them are valid and why, is a topic ready
for considerable further investigation. (See also Bundy 'Doing arithmetic with
diagrams' and Brown 'Doing arithmetic without diagrams'.)
<p>
<a name="10.9."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
10.9. Problems about rationality
</I>
</b></h3>
More importantly perhaps, instead of merely asking which
beliefs, and which rules for inferring beliefs from sense-data,
are rational, we can also ask new questions about rationality,
such as:
<ol type="1">
<li>Which methods of representation is it rational to use for
particular purposes?
<p>
<li>Are there rational procedures for assessing trade-offs,
e.g. trading off increased speed against less economical use
of memory space, or increased flexibility against reduced
speed or heuristic power against loss of generality?
</ol>
That is, in the context of trying to design a working person,
we see rationality as essentially concerned with processes,
strategies, actions and the achievement of goals, rather than
with static relations between static objects like sense-data,
beliefs or propositions. The Marxist slogan 'The unity of
theory and practice' acquires a new life.
<p>
<a name="10.10."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
10.10. Problems about ontology, reductionism, and phenomenalism
</I>
</b></h3>
As remarked previously, much A.I. vision work is
anti-reductionist, anti-atomistic. Programs use a variety of concepts
from different domains, without any need to reduce them to
concepts applicable only to sensory input. Indeed it is
arguable that such reductions would generate enormous
computational problems. It is much simpler to store and make
inferences directly from symbols asserting that one bar
occludes another, than to use some translated version
mentioning only actual and possible dot-configuration which
might depict such a situation. The bar concepts need not even
be in principle definable in terms of actual and possible
sensory data. All that the system needs is a collection of rules
or heuristics for jumping to conclusions about bars on the
basis of retinal patterns. The rules need not constitute a
definition of 'bar'. This sort of relationship between 'theoretical'
and 'empirical' concepts is discussed at length in
contemporary works on philosophy of science, e.g. Nagel, <i>The Structure of Science.</i>
<p>
So we see that the artificial intelligence viewpoint provides
new weapons for philosophers to use in arguments about
phenomenalism and related theories about the nature of
perception. More generally: in exploring the problems of
designing a robot which can interact with the world, learn things
about it, communicate about and reason about it, we are
forced to examine the merits of different ontologies. But
instead of discussing them in a purely theoretical fashion, as
philosophers do, we find that we can put our theories to
some kind of practical test. For example, an ontology which
leads to a robot that is grossly incompetent at relating to the
world is inferior to one which leads to a more successful
design. For more discussion on this issue see McCarthy and
Hayes, 1969.

<a name="10.11."></a>
<h3><b>
<I>
10.11. Problems about scepticism
</I>
</b></h3>
One form of scepticism argues that you cannot ever know
that there is an external world containing other people and
objects, because a 'malicious demon' might be fixing all your
sense-data so as to deceive you.
<p>
Many philosophers have gone to great lengths to try to
refute such scepticism in its various forms. I cannot see why,
for it is harmless enough: like many other philosophical
theories it is devoid of practical consequences.
<p>
It is especially pointless struggling to refute a conclusion
that is true. To see that it is true, consider how a malicious
team of electronic engineers, programmers, and philosophers
might conspire to give a robot a collection of hallucinatory
experiences. (Even the primitive technology of the 1970s
comes reasonably close to this in flight-simulators, designed
to give trainee air pilots the illusion that they are flying real
aeroplanes.) The robot would have no way of telling that it
was tied up in a laboratory, with its limbs removed and its
television inputs connected to a computer instead of
cameras. All its experiences, including experiences resulting
from its own imagined actions, would be quite consistent
with its being out romping in the fields chasing butterflies.
<p>
Only if it tried some sort of action whose possibility had not
been foreseen in the programs controlling its inputs would it
get evidence that all was not as it seemed. (Like a flight
simulator which cannot simulate your getting out of the plane.)
<p>
However, even if you manage to convince yourself that the
sceptical arguments are valid, and you have no way of telling
for sure that you inhabit the sort of world you think you do,
it is not clear that anything of any consequence follows from
this. It does not provide any basis for abandoning any of the
activities you would otherwise be engaged in. In fact it is only
if there is a flaw in the sceptic's argument, and there is some
kind of procedure by which you can establish that you are or are not
the victim of a gross hallucination, that any practical
consequence follows. Namely, it follows that if you care
about truth you should embark on the tests.
<p>Since I find it hard to take discussions of scepticism very
seriously, I have probably failed to do justice to the problem.

<h3><b>
<I>
10.12. The problems of universals
</I>
</b></h3>
<b>How</b> are we able to think of different objects as being of the
same kind? Why do we use the same word, for example,
'rectangle', to describe very many different sorts of objects?
What does it mean to say that many objects 'have something
in common'? Much philosophical discussion, at least since the
time of Plato, has been concerned with these sorts of
questions. Answers have taken a wide variety of forms, including:
<div style="margin-left:-15px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px;">
<ul>
<li>the theory that common properties are as much a part of
the perceivable world as the objects which have those
properties;
<li>the theory  that there is nothing really  common to  objects
which we describe as the same, since we group things
together on the basis of arbitrary conventions;
<li>the theory that such objects have a common relationship
to some kind of mental object (e.g. an image or picture
with which they are compared);
</ul>
</div>
and no doubt many more.
<p>
One of the consequences of trying to give computers the
ability to perceive things is that we have to analyse the
perception of similarities and differences, and the use of
descriptive and classificatory concepts. It seems that the whole thing
cannot get started unless there are some kinds of properties
and relationships which the sensory system can detect by
using measurements or very mechanical (algorithmic)
procedures, like matching against templates.
<p>
But a real visual system has to go far beyond this in constructing and employing
quite elaborate theories as part of the perception process. For example, the
program described in <a href="#chap9">the previous chapter</a> has to use the
<i>theory</i> that one bar partially covers another, to explain a gap in a row
of dots in
the picture. Less obviously, the 'theory' that there is a bar in
a certain place explains the occurrence of some collinear sets
of dots in the sensory image. In view of all the relationships
which can be generated by bar-junctions, by occlusion, and
by juxtaposition of bars, there is little resemblance or
similarity between the different configurations of dots which are
interpreted as representing bars  at least not enough to
distinguish them from others such as configurations which are
interpreted as depicting spaces between bars. So using the
same label or description for two or more objects may rest
on the assumption that they have similar potential for
explaining aspects of our experience. So the application of
higher-level concepts in describing perceived objects has much in
common with the construction of scientific theories to
explain experimental results. This sort of point is missed by
theorists who try to analyse universals in terms
of perceived resemblances or in terms of arbitrary rules or socially
determined conventions. (Structuralism, for instance?)
<p>
From this standpoint, the particular set of concepts, that
is, the set of interpretation procedures and classification rules,
used by an animal or person, will probably be the product of
a long process of exploration and experiment. The rules
which have been most useful in the construction of powerful
explanatory theories will have survived. The process of
testing such theories involves interacting with the world: moving
around, manipulating things, avoiding obstacles, predicting
what will be seen from a new viewpoint. This learning need
not have been done entirely by individuals: insofar as some
mental and behavioural abilities are somehow inherited (for
instance, the new-born foal can walk), there is a sense in
which <i>species</i> can learn  though the mechanism of such
learning is still a mystery to biologists.
<p>
Thus it is to be expected that organisms with partially
similar bodies living in a similar environment, will have
evolved a not entirely different collection of concepts and
theory-building procedures. Such a substratum, common to
the whole human species and many animals, might pervade
the systems of concepts used in all cultures, contrary to the
view that our concepts are essentially <i>social,</i> as claimed in the
later writings of Wittgenstein and many of his admirers. (Of
course, social systems can mould and extend inherited
concepts and abilities.)
<p>
Further exploration of this sort of idea, in the context of
detailed discussion of examples, and the methods by which
programs deal with them, will help us transform old
philosophical problems, like the problem of universals, into new
clearer, deeper problems with which we can make some real
progress, and thereby increase our understanding of ourselves.

A common reaction to the suggestion that human beings are
like computers running complex programs is to object that
that would mean that we are not free, that all our acts and
decisions are based not on deliberation and choice but on
blind deterministic processes. There is a very tangled set of
issues here, but I think that the study of computational
models of decision-making processes may actually give us
better insights into what it is to be free and responsible. This
is because people are increasingly designing programs which,
instead of blindly doing what they are told, build up
representations of alternative possibilities and study them in some
detail before choosing. This is just the first step towards real
deliberation and freedom of choice.
<p>
In due course, it should be possible to design systems
which, instead of always taking decisions on the basis of
criteria explicitly programmed in to them (or specified in the
task), try to construct their own goals, criteria and principles,
for instance by exploring alternatives and finding which are
most satisfactory to live with. Thus, having decided between
alternative decision-making strategies, the program may use
them in taking other decisions.
<p>
For all this to work the program must of course have some
desires, goals, strategies built into it initially. But that
presumably is true of people also. A creature with no wants,
aims, preferences, dislikes, decision-making strategies, etc.,
would have no basis for doing any deliberating or acting. But
the initial collection of programs need not survive for long, as
the individual interacts with the physical world and other
agents over a long period of time, and through a lengthy and
unique history extends, modifies, and rejects the initial
program. Thus a robot, like a person, could have built into it
mechanisms which succeed in altering themselves beyond
recognition, partly under the influence of experiences of
many sorts.
Self-modification could apply not only to goals but also to the
mechanisms or rules for generating and for comparing goals, and even,
recursively, to the mechanisms for change.
<p>
This is a long way from the popular mythology of computers as simple-minded
mechanisms which always do exactly what they are programmed to do. A
self-modifying program, of the sort described in <a href="#chap6">Chapter 6</a>,
interacting with many people in many situations, could develop so as to be quite
unrecognisable by its initial designer(s). It could acquire not only new facts
and new skills, but also new motivations; that is desires, dislikes, principles,
and so on. Its actions would be determined by its own motives, not those of its
designers.
<p>
If this is not having
freedom and being responsible for one's own development
and actions, then it is not at all clear what else could be
desired under the name of freedom.
<p>
As people become increasingly aware of the enormous
differences between these new sorts of mechanisms, and the
sorts of things which have been called mechanisms in the past
(clocks, typewriters, telephone exchanges, and even simple
computers with simple programs), they will also become less
worried about the mechanistic overtones of computer models
of mind. (See also my 1974 paper on determinism.)

<h3><b>
<I>
10.14. Problems about the analysis of emotions
</I>
</b></h3>
At various points I have stressed the cognitive basis of
emotional states (e.g. in <a href="#chap4">the chapter on conceptual
analysis, Chapter 4</a>).
I have also stressed several times that in an intelligent system
there will have to be not just one computational process, but
many, all interacting with others. One possible way of
analysing emotional states and personality differences, is in terms
of different kinds of organisation and control of processing.
<p>
For example, my colleague Steve Hardy once remarked
that programs which get involved in 'depth-first' searches,
where one of the possible current moves is always chosen,
and then one of the moves made possible as a result of that
move, and so on, may be described as essentially <i>optimistic</i>
programs. Similarly, a program which does 'breadth-first'
searches, explicitly keeping all its options open and
continually going back to examine other alternatives instead of
pushing ahead with a chosen one, could be described as a
<i>pessimistic</i> program. (The POPEYE program falls somewhere
between these extremes.) Of course the program itself is
neither optimistic nor pessimistic unless it has been involved
in some explicit consideration of the alternative strategies,
and has selected one of them. These are simple extreme cases.
<p>
Much more complex patterns of control may be involved in a
real robot, and by examining different possibilities we can
hope to gain new insights into the nature of emotions, moods
and the like.
<p>
However, it is important to be on guard against superficial
computer models. Often by clever programming, people can
produce quite convincing displays of something like a mental
state, when closer inspection reveals that something very
different was going on.
<br>
[[This is why the Turing test is of no philosophical significance,
since it concentrates only on external behaviour.]]
<br>
For example, if hunger, or degree of
paranoia, is represented as the value of some numerical
variable then that clearly does not do justice to what are
actually very much more complex states in people. For
example, as anthropologists are fond of pointing out: hunger
is not a simple drive to eat. Rather it is a very complex state
in which aspects of a culture may be involved.
In some communities a hungry person will happily eat
caterpillars, locusts, snails, or whatever, whereas members of other
communities find such things quite unappetising even when
they are very hungry.
<p>
More complex desires, emotions, attitudes, etc., involve a
large collection of beliefs, hopes, fears, thinking strategies,
decision-making strategies, and perhaps conflicts between
different sub-processes of the sorts described previously. At
the moment, modelling such aspects of the human mind
adequately is simply beyond the state of the art. This is why
it is sometimes tempting to take short cuts and make
superficial comparisons.

<I>
10.15. Conclusion
</I>
</b></h3>
This concludes what can only be regarded as a set of notes
requiring extensive further discussion. Moreover, the list of
headings is incomplete. There are many areas of interaction
between philosophy and computing which have not been
discussed. Some of them have been mentioned in other chapters.
Some, like the theory of meaning (including problems of
sense and reference), will have to be discussed on another
occasion. Moreover, new points of contact are rapidly
emerging. For example, just before finishing this book, I read a
review by Meltzer of a PhD thesis by D. Lenat reporting on
a program which explores mathematical concepts looking for
'interesting' new relationships. The program was able to
invent for itself the concept of a prime number and other
mathematically important concepts. I have not read the
thesis myself, but it is unlikely that the program acquired a
very deep understanding of any of the concepts it created.
Nevertheless it is still one of the important steps down the
long long road to understanding how we work.
<p>
If all this succeeds in making most readers want to find out
more about A.I., and encourages some people working in A.I.
to be more self-conscious about the philosophical
presuppositions and implications of their work, then this book will
have been worthwhile. I hope a significant subset of readers
will be tempted to try <i>doing</i> artificial intelligence. This will
become easier with the spread of cheaper and more powerful
computing facilities, and with the design of improved
programming languages. The increasing flow of books and articles
on A.I. is also a help. Above all, computers and programming
will play an increasing role in educational systems, so that
philosophy students of the future will not find the new
approach as alien as some of their less well educated tutors do.
<p>
At the end of chapter 9, I listed some of the reasons why
existing A.I. programs cannot be taken too seriously as
models or theories of how people do things. Despite this, the
work is essential to the study of how people work (a) because
it exposes previously unnoticed problems  for instance by
showing that even apparently simple abilities depend on very
complex computational processes, and (b) because a major
obstacle to progress is our lack of adequate theory-building
tools, and A.I. research is constantly creating new tools, in
the form of new concepts, new symbolisms, new
programming techniques, and new aids to exploring and 'debugging'
complex theories. I have begun to illustrate some of the
techniques in previous chapters.
<p>
Although most of what I have said about A.I. has been
concerned with its relationships to philosophical problems, I
have also argued that there are strong links with
developmental psychology and educational studies. The new insights
provided by this sort of work could have a far-reaching effect on
a whole range of problems and activities which I have not
discussed. For example, in time very many disorders of
personality and intellect may be much better understood by thinking
of them as involving computational problems (by contrast
with regarding them as due to some kind of brain
malfunction, to be treated by drugs or surgery, or adopting
approaches akin to psychoanalysis without a computational
theory to underpin the therapy).
<p>
Of course, all this new knowledge might be abused, but
it might also lead to great advances in our efforts to help
children learn complex concepts, and our attempts to help those
whose lives are impoverished by malfunctions ranging from
dyslexia to emotional disturbances with a cognitive basis. It
is already leading to new advances in teaching techniques, for
instance at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, and
the Universities of Edinburgh and Sussex, where new
programming languages influenced by languages developed for
A.I. are used for teaching computer programming to pupils
who previously thought of themselves as bad at mathematics
and the use of symbols.<a href="#chap10-note1">[1]</a>
<p>
So the title of this book is somewhat misleading. The
revolution I have been discussing involves much more than
philosophy. The impact of computers and computing on
philosophy is merely one facet of a transformation of ways
of thinking about complex systems and processes which will
increasingly pervade many aspects of our lives and change our
image of ourselves. It will thereby change what we are.
<p>
Some people regard this as some kind of disaster, and even
suggest that the attitude of A.I. researchers and the work
they produce can be degrading or dehumanising. For instance,
Weizenbaum (1975) comments that when his secretary
wished to be left in private while she conversed with a
computer, and objected that his plan to record all conversations
with his 'Eliza' program was an intrusion into people's
privacy, he thought that this showed that she was in some sense
suffering from a delusion and degrading herself (p. 6). What
he apparently did not see is that this is not very different
from wanting to be left in private when writing in a book
'Dear Diary .... '. Suitably programmed computers are much
more fun to interact with than a blank page in a book, and
the Eliza program is a specially good example.
<p>
Moreover the increasing use of computational metaphors
for thinking about people is no more degrading than the use
of metaphors previously available as a result of advances in
science and technology, like the metaphors generated by
steam power technology: 'She needs to let off steam'. The
pressure built up inside him', 'He uses music-making as a
safety-valve', 'He was ready to explode', and so on. The
difference is that the new metaphors are richer in explanatory
power, as I have tried to show throughout this book.

(1) Of course, in the short run such developments can only have a tiny
effect on the mass of the population. Worse, our educational system
--- and I include parents, families, churches, prisons, the press,
television,
and the pronouncements of politicians, in this  --- is
failing so miserably
in so many different ways, that giving everybody a superb grasp of
mathematics would still leave much more serious problems: like
preparing people adequately for marriage and other personal
relationships,
making them politically aware and sophisticated, and above all making
them thoughtful, considerate, and able to co-operate fruitfully.

<b>Note on "Singularity"</b> (Revised: 9 Jul 2017)
<blockquote>
It is very likely that people reading this in the 21st Century have encountered
claims and discussions about how soon machine intelligence will match or
overtake human intelligence (the "singularity"). All those claims are based on
shallow analysis of the depth of natural intelligence (not just in humans, but
also elephants, crows, squirrels, orangutans, and many others). Their
intelligence includes features that current AI is not even close to matching. In
particular humans (even pre-verbal toddlers) and other animals have abilities to
understand and reason about novel spatial structures and processes that seem to
be precursors of the abilities of ancient mathematicians like Euclid, Zeno and
Archimedes. Current automated theorem provers don't seem to be close to being
able to make such mathematical discoveries, although they outperform the
logical, numerical, and algebraic reasoning of most humans. For more on this see

I am not claiming that AI systems will <i>never</i> match natural
intelligence---merely that there are deep challenges that mostly go unnoticed
by researchers in AI, neuroscience, cognitive science and other disciplines.

<b>ORIGINAL EPILOGUE</b>
<br>
It is curious how theists and atheists can be united in their
opposition to one or more of the following theses:
<p>
<ol type="a">
<p>
<li>It is possible for scientific investigation to lead to an
understanding of how human minds work.
<p>
<li>It is desirable to understand how human minds work.
<p>
<li>The methods of artificial intelligence can make a
significant contribution to this study.
<p>
<li>Artefacts will one day be made which can think, feel,
create, and communicate with one another and with
people.
<p>
<li>It is desirable that such machines should be made.
</ol>
I am inclined to accept all of these theses, though unlike
some optimists and prophets of doom I doubt that really
intelligent conscious machines will be made in the near future.
Only a few tiny fragments of the spectrum of human abilities
have begun to be simulated. I do not think the remaining
problems will be solved in the next hundred years.
<p>
Further, I have some doubts about (e)  the desirability of
making intelligent machines. This is because, on the whole,
human beings are not fit to be the custodians of a new form of life.
<p>
It will not be possible to devise really helpful servants
without giving them desires, attitudes and emotions (see chapters
6 and 10). For instance, they will sometimes have to feel the
need for great urgency when things are going wrong and
something has to be done about it. Some of them will need
to have the ability to <i>develop</i> their motives in the light of
experience, if they are to cope with changing situations
(including changing personal relations), with real intelligence
and wisdom. This raises the possibility of their acquiring aims
and desires not foreseen by their designers. Will people be
prepared to take account of their desires?
<p>
History suggests that the invention of such robots will be
followed by their exploitation and slavery, or at the very least
racial discrimination against them. Will young robots, thirsty
for knowledge, be admitted to our schools and universities?
Will we let them join our clubs and societies? Will we let them
vote? Will they have equal employment opportunities?
Probably not. Either they will be forcibly suppressed, or, perhaps
worse, their minds will be designed to have limits: both their
desires and their intellectual potential will be manipulated so
as to safeguard the interests of people, like the 'deltas' in
Huxley's <i>Brave New World.</i>
<p>
It is interesting that so many people find the Brave New
World techniques abhorrent when applied to human test-tube
babies, but would not mind similar treatment being dealt to
robots. Is it too extreme to call that racialism?
<p>
<I>
My favourite proof of the non-existence of a benevolent god argues
that no good god would create things like mice and men with
powerful desires and needs, but without the opportunities, character,
intelligence and abilities required for fulfilling them.
</I>
<p>
There will, of course, be a
<I>
Society for the Liberation of Robots,
</I>
since some humans are occasionally
motivated by a
wish to diminish suffering and oppression even when they
have nothing to gain.
<p>
Where it will all lead to, we cannot foretell. My only hope
is that we shall be lucky enough to produce a breed of
machines with the wisdom and skill to teach us to abandon
all those deep insecurities which turn us into racialists of one
sort or another  probably closely connected with the
processes which turn people to religion.
<p>
The state of the world gives little cause for optimism.
Maybe the robots will be generous and allow us to inhabit asylums
and reserves, where we shall be well cared-for and permitted
to harm only other human beings, with no other weapons
than clubs and stones, and perhaps the occasional
neutron-bomb to control the population.

<b>NOTE Added 2 Jul 2015</b>
<br>
Since this book was written, nearly 40 years ago, there have been massive
advances in the variety of types of demonstration of AI systems, and in
restricted contexts -- e.g. playing chess, solving certain classes of
mathematical problem, finding patterns in very large collections of textual or
image information -- current machines significantly outperform most humans. But
there is no AI system that can start its life with the mind of a baby, develop
as a human toddler does, and eventually "grow up" to be a mathematician, a
ballet dancer, a plumber, a baby-minder, a concert violinist, or most of the
other things done by humans, or even the things done by squirrels, elephants,
crows, weaver birds, and other intelligent animals.
<p>
I think that's mainly because we understand so little about the variety of forms
of information processing produced by natural selection. For example, long
before there were any mathematics teachers our ancestors began to make
discoveries about geometry, topology, integers (whole numbers), fractions
(ratios of integers) and real numbers and eventually those discoveries were
organised into what is arguably the most important book ever published namely
Euclid's Elements -- although it turned out to be a small beginning on a huge
journey into mathematical discovery. I suspect these discoveries grew out of
abilities to perceive and make use of affordances and restrictions in the
environment in more complex and varied ways than J.J. Gibson noticed.

our knowledge and devise a method for searching for answers, triggered by
reading Turing's

<p>
Only people who don't understand the remaining huge gaps between AI systems and
intelligent products of biological evolution can take seriously claims that
human intelligence will be surpassed by machine intelligence in the next few
decades. Perhaps in the next few centuries we'll understand enough about the
problems and space of solutions explored by evolution.

POSTSCRIPT
<br>
DO WE NEED A HIERARCHY OF METALANGUAGES?
</b></h2>

It is widely believed that the work of Russell and Tarski has
established that we need a hierarchy of distinct metalanguages,
if we wish to use concepts like 'true', 'refers to' and other
semantic concepts. The argument is based on such facts as
that a sentence like
<blockquote>
"This statement is not true"
</blockquote>
must be false if it is true, and true if it is false. This, and other
versions of the liar paradox, and related paradoxes, can be
used to show that if the law of the excluded middle is correct
(every statement is either true or not true) then
contradictions can be generated in languages which 'contain their own
metalanguage'.
<p>
Many philosophers and logicians have inferred from this
that only a hierarchy of
distinct metalanguages provides a safe framework for precise and
rigorous theorising in science or mathematics.
I have argued against this in my 1971 paper ('Tarski Frege and the Liar
Paradox')<a href="#postscript-sloman71">[3]</a>,
but would now like to illustrate the way in which precise,
rigorous, and widely used programming languages generate similar
paradoxes in a very natural and easily understood way.
<p>
In the AI programming language Pop-11<a href="#postscript-note1">[1]</a> this is
how you can define a little program<a href="#postscript-note2">[2]</a>
which tests whether a list evaluates
to <b>true</b>:
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>
define ISTRUE(list);
    pop11_compile(list) = true
enddefine;
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
So using the procedure <b>pr</b> to print the result produced by
the procedure <b>ISTRUE</b>:
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>pr(ISTRUE( [ 8 &gt; 5 ] ));
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
prints out:
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>&lt;true&gt;
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
since 8 is bigger than 5, whereas:
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>pr(ISTRUE( [isinteger("cat")] ));
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
prints out:
<blockquote>
<font size="+1"><pre><b>&lt;false&gt;
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
because the <I>word</I> "cat" in is not an <I>integer</I>.
<p>
We can declare a variable name S, thus:
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>vars S;
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
Now assign to it a list which asserts that what S says is not
true:
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>[not(ISTRUE(S))]  -> S;
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
If we now ask the Pop-11 system to check whether S is true
and print out the result, thus:
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>pr(ISTRUE(S));
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
the system grinds to a halt and prints out an error message,
because of the 'infinite recursion' generated, i.e. it runs out
of work-space trying to tell if S is true, which requires
working out if S is true, which requires working out if S is true ...
<p>
So we have no contradiction, just a non-terminating process, which
happens to be stopped when memory runs out. (In some implementations of
this sort of language, so-called 'tail-recursion optimisation' might be
used, which would prevent memory running out and the program would run
forever.)
<p>
There is a <I>contradiction</I> only if you assume that every
well-formed sentence (including S) must have a definite truth-value,
a common prejudice, for which there is no foundation.
<p>
We can do a similar demonstration with Russell's paradox.
Pop-11, like many other programming languages, has built in
procedures which work as predicates, producing a truth value
when applied to an argument, e.g. <b>isinteger</b>, <b>isword</b>,
<b>isprocedure</b>. These are all objects of type procedure, in Pop-11.
So:
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>pr(isinteger(3));
&lt;true&gt;
pr(isprocedure(isinteger));
&lt;true&gt;
pr(isinteger(isinteger));
&lt;false&gt;
pr(isprocedure(isprocedure));
&lt;true&gt;
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
We can define a new procedure, called RUSSELL, as follows:
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>define RUSSELL(f);
    not(f(f))
enddefine;
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
This defines RUSSELL as a predicate.
The command
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>pr(RUSSELL(isprocedure));
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
causes
isprocedure to be applied to itself, yielding
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>&lt;true&gt;
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
which is
then negated, and
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>&lt;false&gt
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
is printed out.
<p>
Similarly
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>pr(RUSSELL(isinteger));
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
causes
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>&lt;true&gt;
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
to be
printed out, since <b>isinteger</b> is a procedure, not an integer.
So the procedure is perfectly well defined, and generally works.
<p>
However, execution of the command
<blockquote>
<font size="+1">
<pre><b>pr(RUSSELL(RUSSELL));
</b></pre>
</font>
</blockquote>
cannot terminate
until it has checked whether <b>RUSSELL</b> applied to <b>RUSSELL</b>
yields <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>, which in turn needs the same check.
So once again the system starts infinite recursion, and eventually
grinds to a halt with an error message if memory runs out.
<p>
Far from showing a need for a hierarchy of distinct metalanguages.
this merely illustrates the fact that a well-formed
expression with a clear sense, (e.g. a clearly defined
evaluation procedure), need not determine a definite reference
(e.g. because the procedure never terminates). This is
inevitable in any general purpose programming language.
No wonder it is a feature of natural languages.

<h3><b>
Note added 1 Jan 2018: Allowing run time errors
</b></h3>
In several programming languages designed (after this book was written) by
computer scientists who wished to eliminate the possibility of a program that
compiles successfully to machine code ever generating an error when run, the
level of generality of languages like Pop-11, Lisp and Prolog was lost. This may
be a price worth paying when a language is to be used for software engineering
applications. My experience suggests that it is not worth paying for a language
to be used for scientific research that involves attempting to model natural
cognitive processes, including muddled thinking, hallucinations and logical or
mathematical errors. But such a language will need additional run-time debugging
tools to help researchers (or even the agents modelled) to find out what has
gone wrong and and to fix it -- when the aim is not merely to demonstrate how
erroneous thinking and reasoning can occur!

<b>[1]</b> In the original (1978) version of the book,
the programming examples used the syntax of the language POP2
(Burstall et al 1973). In this version (Sept 2001) I
have changed the syntax to that

BIBLIOGRAPHY

[Note: Sept 2001
<br>
This was not a comprehensive bibliography even in 1978. It merely
lists a subset of the publications that had influenced my thinking,
referred to in the book. Margaret Boden's 1977 book provides a far more
comprehensive bibliography for that time.]
