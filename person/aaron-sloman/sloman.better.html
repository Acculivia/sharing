<h2>
<font size="4"><i>A. The programme</i></font>
</h2>

ONE type of naturalistic analysis of words like &quot;good,&quot;
&quot;ought,&quot; and &quot;better&quot; defines them in terms of
criteria for applicability which vary from one context to another (as in
&quot;good men,&quot; &quot;good typewriter,&quot; &quot;good method of
proof&quot;), so that their meanings vary with context. Dissatisfaction
with this &quot;crude&quot; naturalism leads some philosophers to
suggest that the words have a context-independent non-descriptive
meaning
defined in terms of such things as expressing emotions, commanding,
persuading, or guiding actions.
<p>

There are well-known objections to both approaches, and the aim of this
paper is to suggest an alternative which has apparently never previously
been considered, for the very good reason that at first sight it looks
so unpromising, namely the alternative of defining the problematic words
as logical constants.

<p>
This should not be confused with the programme of treating them as
undefined symbols in a formal system, which is not new. In this essay an
attempt will be made to define a logical constant &quot;Better&quot;
which has surprisingly many of the features of the ordinary word
&quot;better&quot; in a large number of contexts. It can then be shown
that other important uses of &quot;better&quot; may be thought of as
derived from this use of the word as a logical constant.

<p>
The new symbol is a logical constant in that its definition (i.e., the
specification of formation rules and truth-conditions for statements
using it) makes use only of such concepts as &quot;entailment,&quot;
&quot;satisfying a condition,&quot; &quot;relation,&quot; &quot;set of
properties,&quot; which would generally be regarded as purely logical
concepts. In particular, the definition makes no reference to wants,
desires, purposes, interests, prescriptions, choice, non-descriptive
uses
of language, and the other paraphernalia of non-naturalistic (and some
naturalistic) analyses of evaluative words.

<p>
<h2>
<font size="4"><i>B.
&quot;Better&quot; defined as a logical constant.</i></font>
</h2>
<b>
(B1)
</b>
In English, such phrases as &quot;better for ...,&quot; &quot;better
at ..,&quot; &quot;better as a ...&quot; normally
indicate the use of the concept here to be discussed: in this
sense one thing cannot be better than another except in relation
to what I call a <i>basis of comparison, B</i>, which is more or less
explicitly indicated by what follows &quot;for,&quot; &quot;at,&quot; or
&quot;as a&quot;, in the above constructions.

<p>
Until a basis has been specified, the question &quot;Which is
better?&quot; has no answer, and the assertion &quot;x is better than
y&quot; is ambiguous. (Sometimes the question has no answer even when
there is a basis, if the basis is not sufficiently specific, as will be
seen below.)

<p>
Calling statements using &quot;better&quot; in the above sense
<i>comparisons</i>,  we easily see that comparisons relative to a basis
<i>B</i>  may have many different forms. For example, if <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> are particular things capable of being compared relative to
<i>B</i>, and if <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i>  are properties capable of being
possessed by such things, and <i>R-er</i>  a relation capable of holding
between such things, then the following are among the possible forms of
comparison:

<blockquote>
(i) <i>x</i> is better than y relative to <i>B.</i>
<br>
(ii)
Being <i>P</i> is better than being Q relative to <i>B.
<br>
</i>(iii) The R-er the better relative to <i>B</i>.
<br>
(iv) The R-er the better relative  to <i>B</i>, other things being
equal.
<br>
(v) <i>x</i> is better than most (all, some) <i>P</i>
things relative to <i>B.</i>
</blockquote>

Of course, different grammatical forms may be used in ordinary
discourse: in particular, grammar may be a very poor guide to logical
structure of comparisons when the basis is not made fully
explicit.
<p>

<b>
(B2)
</b>
We shall analyze comparisons of form (ii), which can be symbolized
as Better(P, Q, B), since this is the most important form. For example,
to see that form (i) depends on (ii) notice that which of two objects
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> is better relative to a basis <i>B</i> must always
depend ultimately on their qualities, capacities, or relational
properties, so that there is some difference <i>in virtue of which
</i>one is better. In short, &quot;better&quot; in (i) is
<i>supervenient</i> or <i>consequential</i>.

<p>
The fault of crude naturalism is to <i>define</i> &quot;better&quot; in
terms of the qualities, etc., in question. Our aim, roughly, is to
define the relation between the better-making qualities and the basis of
comparison, a relation which remains unaltered when qualities
and basis change, and which can be defined in purely logical
terms, approximately as follows: being <i>P</i> is better than being Q
relative to <i>B</i> if and only if being <i>P</i> is more conducive to
satisfying some condition <i>C</i> specified in <i>B</i>, than being Q
is.<i></i> This approximate definition will now be made more precise in
several stages. We first define a concept &quot;absolutely better
relative to <i>B,&quot;</i> then a concept &quot;comparatively better
relative to <i>B,&quot;</i> then define &quot;better relative to
<i>B&quot;</i> as &quot;absolutely or comparatively better, relative to
<i>B.&quot;</i>


<p>
<b>
(B3)
</b>
The basis <i>B</i> may have an inner structure, as in &quot;This
type of lathe is better in respect of precision (though not speed) for
cutting lamp-stands out of wood, while that type is better when metal is
used.&quot;

<p>
What I call a &quot;fundamental basis&quot; consists of four factors: a
reference condition <i>C</i>, a respect of comparison <i>R</i>, the circumstances of
comparison (or situation of comparison) <i>S</i>, and a subclass of comparison
<i>Z</i>. A <i>fundamental comparison</i> has the form &quot;Better(P,
Q, B),&quot; where <i>B</i> is a fundamental basis, so that the whole
structure can be symbolized as &quot;Better(<i>(P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>).&quot;
This can be read: &quot;Being <i>P</i> is better in respect <i>R</i>
than being <i>Q</i> with reference to satisfying condition <i>C</i>, in
circumstances <i>S</i>, for members of the class <i>Z</i>.&quot;

<p>
Other types of basis, and other forms of comparison, may be derived from
the &quot;fundamental&quot; kind by quantifying over <i>R, S</i>,  or <i>Z</i>,
or applying other weighing up operators to them, as we shall see later.

<p>
The reference condition <i>C</i> is the most important factor in the
basis, since (roughly speaking) conduciveness to satisfying condition <i>C</i>
is what determines whether being <i>P</i> or being <i>Q</i> is better. In
ordinary discourse the precise reference condition is often not made
explicit. For example, when we say &quot;This is a better clock than
that,&quot; the condition <i>C</i> is not just being a clock, but
(something like) being able to tell the time accurately. In this case
subtle conventions about functional concepts enable us to infer what the
reference condition is. But the condition <i>could</i> be expressed
quite explicitly, as in &quot;This is better than that at telling the
time accurately.&quot;
<p>

Our analysis will be concerned only with the meaning of comparisons
where the reference condition is made explicit (I shall deal on another
occasion with the linguistic and other devices by which we manage to
avoid the need for such precision in ordinary English.[4])
We must now take
a closer look at the four factors, <i>C, R, S</i>, and <i>Z</i>.
<p>

<b>
(B4)
</b>
Any condition which things can fit, or fulfil, or satisfy, or fail to fit, fulfil,
or satisfy, can be the reference condition C of a comparison.
<p>

<i>C</i> need not refer to the wants, purposes, interests, or needs of any
person or set of persons. Further, to use <i>C</i> as reference
condition in a basis of comparison is not to imply that anybody actually
wants or is ever likely to want <i>C</i> to be satisfied. For example,
&quot;being usable for sawing off one's own leg with as much pain as
possible&quot; <i>could</i> be a reference condition, even though no one
ever in fact makes comparisons relative to it.
<p>

Further, <i>C</i> may be vague (e.g., &quot;being able to travel
fast&quot;), may be unsatisfiable (e.g., &quot;being able to get from
<i>A</i> to <i>B</i> instantaneously&quot;), and may be capable of being
satisfied to different degrees. An important task still to be carried
out is a survey of different types of reference conditions, with a view
to bringing out the logical differences between the comparisons in which
they can occur.

<p>
<b>
(B5)
</b>
To see why other factors besides <i>C</i> are sometimes needed in
the basis, notice that the question &quot;Which is more conducive to
satisfaction of <i>C</i>?&quot;
may have no answer until some or all of <i>R</i>,
<i>S</i>, and <i>Z</i> have been specified.

<p>
Thus, if we are comparing two types of machines, <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i>, with
reference to the condition <i>C</i> &quot;being usable for cutting
grass,&quot; it may be that in one respect <i>R1</i> (e.g., speed)
<i>P</i> is better, while in another respect <i>R2</i> (e.g., ease of
operation) <i>Q</i> is better, neither <i>P</i> nor <i>Q</i> being
better <i>simply</i> with reference to <i>C</i>. Similarly one type may be
better in some circumstances <i>S1</i> (e.g., uneven terrain) while the
other is better in circumstances <i>S2</i> (e.g., flat terrain).

<p>
Further, even if a respect <i>R</i> and circumstances <i>S</i> have been
specified, neither being <i>P</i> nor being <i>Q</i> may be definitely better with
reference to satisfying <i>C</i>, except for things of type <i>Z1</i> or things of
type <i>Z2</i>, where possession of property <i>P</i> is better in the former
case, <i>Q</i> in the latter. E.g., which type of metal should be used for the
blades of a lawnmower for greatest ease of operation on level ground may
depend on which of several possible configurations is used for the
blades.

<p>
<b>
(B6)
</b>
The circumstances <i>S</i>, or the subclass of comparison <i>Z</i>, may
appear from the above explanation to be merely part of the reference
condition, as if things were being compared with reference to a new
condition <i>C'</i>, namely the condition of satisfying <i>C</i> in
circumstances <i>S</i> while being a member of <i>Z</i>.

<p>
However, the reason for treating <i>S</i> and <i>Z</i> as separate factors in
the basis, as will become clearer later on, is that we need to allow
them to vary while <i>C</i> remains constant, if we are to construct a
general theory of comparisons: e.g., &quot;<i>ceteris paribus</i>&quot;
clauses may involve quantification over <i>S</i> and <i>Z</i> while
<i>C</i> is fixed.

<p>
Similarly we want the respect of comparison <i>R</i> to be distinguished
from the reference condition, so that we may ask such questions as: Is
this respect relevant to condition <i>C</i>? To clarify this we need to
make the notion of a respect precise. In general when we refer to a
respect we seem to be referring to a kind of property, or a set of
properties. For example, in saying that <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are
exactly similar in respect to height we mean that among the class of
possible heights there is one which is a property of both <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i>. Similarly the class of possible distances from New York is
referred to when we say that two towns differ in respect to distance
from New York.
<p>

In short, a respect is a <i>determinable</i>, each of whose determinates is a
quality or feature or relational property. (This notion of a set of
properties of the same kind could be analyzed further, but will not be
here.) To render the discussion manageable it is necessary to restrict
it to what I call <i>one-dimensional respects</i>; namely, classes of
properties of the same kind completely ordered along one dimension by a
transitive asymmetric relation (and consequently also its converse).
Thus the set of heights is ordered by the relation &quot;higher&quot;
and its converse &quot;less high,&quot; which I call the <i>associated
relations </i>of the set.
<p>

By contrast, the set of three-dimensional shapes is not
completely ordered in a natural way by any relation (though an order can
be imposed on the set, for example, by projecting it onto the set of
ratios of maximum and minimum diameters). If <i>R</i> is a set of
properties completely ordered by the relations <i>R-er</i> and (its
converse) <i>less-R</i>, I call the latter the associated relations of
the (one-dimensional) respect <i>R.</i> (Strictly speaking, the respect
consists of <i>R</i> and the relations, since the set of properties need
not uniquely determine the relations. Thus the set of <i>lengths</i> is
completely ordered both by &quot;longer&quot; and by &quot;closer to 10
feet long,&quot; though the orders arc different. A failure to grasp
this point leads some people to make irrelevant objections to the
definition given below.)

<p>

<b>
(B7)
</b>
With reference to the condition <i>C</i> of being usable for
cutting grass, differences in some respects (e.g., color) are clearly
irrelevant, while others (e.g., speed) are relevant. Further, a respect
which is relevant in some circumstances may be irrelevant in others. For
example, if the grass is being cut in a field where there is a large
potentially dangerous animal which reacts violently to red objects
(e.g., by charging them), then differences in &quot;color may well be
relevant to <i>C</i>, in these circumstances. Investigation of a large
number of examples suggests the following as a first approximation to a
definition of &quot;relevance.&quot;
<p>


<p>
<blockquote>
<i>Definition:</i>
<br>
&quot;The respect <i>R</i> is <i>relevant</i> to the condition C, in
circumstances <i>S</i>, for members of  <i>Z</i>&quot; means
&quot;There is some proper subset of the set <i>R</i> such that
possessing a property in the subset is a logically necessary condition
for satisfying <i>C</i>, for members of <i>Z</i> in circumstances
<i>S.&quot;</i>
</blockquote>
<p>

If <i>C</i> is the condition of being small enough to fit through a
rectangular opening 4 feet high and 3 feet wide, then in accordance with
the above definition we find that height and width are respects which
are relevant to <i>C</i> (in all circumstances), while colour is
irrelevant (except perhaps in certain bizarre circumstances). It should
be noted that the mere fact that two things differ in a respect which is
relevant to a condition <i>C</i> does not imply that either is better
than the other in that respect with reference to satisfying <i>C</i>. It
should also be noted that the proper subset of <i>R</i> mentioned in the
definition may include all the properties in <i>R</i> but one. For
example, if <i>C</i> is &quot;being usable for cutting grass,&quot; and
<i>R</i> is the set of speeds of cutting grass, then since possessing
some speed <i>other than zero</i> is necessary for satisfying <i>C</i>,
it follows that <i>R</i> is a relevant respect. The opposite case occurs
if <i>C</i> is the condition of being usable for cutting grass as fast
as possible: here the subset of <i>R</i> contains only one speed, the
highest possible.
<p>

(The definition of relevance could be generalized, in
a more complete discussion, first so as to allow probabilistic
relations, and secondly so as to include &quot;indirect relevance,&quot;
i.e., the case where there is some other respect <i>R*</i> such that
<i>R*</i> is relevant to <i>C</i> in the above sense, while differences in
respect <i>R</i> entail differences in respect <i>R*</i>.)
<p>
We now
explain how if <i>R</i> is relevant to <i>C</i>, differences in respect
<i>R</i> can make a difference to whether C is satisfied, or the degree
to which <i>C</i> is satisfied, or the degree to which things
approximate to satisfying C.</span><br>

<p>

<b>
(B8)
</b>
First we need a notion of &quot;absolute betterness,&quot; to be
used in statements of the form &quot;Being <i>P</i> is absolutely better
than being <i>Q</i> with reference to satisfying C, for members of
<i>Z</i> in circumstances <i>S,&quot;</i> which we symbolize as
&quot;Abs-better(<i>P,Q,C,S,Z</i>),&quot; and define as follows:</span>

<p>
<blockquote>
<i>Definition:</i>
<br>
&quot;Abs-better(P,Q,C,S,Z)&quot; means &quot;For members of
<i>Z</i> in
circumstances S<i></i>, either (a) being <i>P</i> entails[1]
satisfying <i>C</i> while being Q. does not, or (b) being
<i>Q</i> entails satisfying not-C while being <i>P</i> does not, or
both (a) and (b) hold.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p>

(To avoid various complications it is necessary to regard
&quot;Abs-better(P,Q,C,S,Z)&quot; as false,
or ill-formed, if either <i>P</i> or <i>Q.</i> is self-contradictory.)

<p>
Our problem now is to generalize this to include mention of a respect of
comparison, as in the phrase &quot;absolutely better in respect
<i>R</i>, with reference to C.&quot;
<p>

For example, suppose <i>C</i> is the condition
of being at most 4 feet high and at most 3 feet wide, <i>P</i> the
property of having a width of 4 feet and a height of 3 feet, while <i>Q</i> is
the property of having a width of 3.5 feet and a height of 5 feet. Then
with reference to <i>C</i> neither being <i>P</i> nor being <i>Q</i> is
absolutely better than the other. But I shall say that with reference to
<i>C</i> being <i>P</i> is absolutely better <i>in respect to
height</i>.
Why? Because being <i>P</i> entails having a height in the range
necessary for satisfaction of G. This can all be made more precise as
follows:</span><br>


<p>
<blockquote>
<i>Definition:</i>
<br>
&quot;<i>C*</i> is the R-derived condition of <i>C</i>, for
members of <i>Z</i>, in circumstances <i>S</i>&quot;means
&quot;<i>C*</i> is the condition of possessing one of the properties
in the smallest subset of <i>R</i> such that for
members of <i>Z</i> possessing some property in the
subset is necessary for satisfaction of condition
<i>C</i> in circumstances <i>S</i>.&quot;</span><br>
</blockquote>
<p>


<blockquote>
<i>Definition:</i>
<br>
&quot;Abs-better(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>)&quot; means
&quot;Abs-better(<i>P,Q,C*,S, Z</i>), where <i>C*</i>
is the R-derived condition of <i>C</i>,
for members of <i>Z</i> in circumstances <i>S</i>.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p>

Thus, being <i>P</i> is absolutely better in respect <i>R</i> than being
<i>Q</i>, with reference to satisfying <i>C</i>, if being <i>P</i> ensures or
being <i>Q</i>, prevents, possession of at least one of the properties in the
range <i>R</i> which are necessary for satisfaction of <i>C</i>. Notice
how the relevance of <i>R</i>, as defined previously, is used in these
definitions.


<p>
<b>
(B9)
</b>
This notion of absolute betterness has to be supplemented now with
a notion of comparative betterness. Whereas the former can be thought of
metaphorically in terms of &quot;black and white&quot; distinctions,
i.e. the distinction between satisfaction and non-satisfaction of a
condition, the latter is concerned with matters of degree, distinctions
of shade, etc., as in &quot;You, are getting better all the time, though
you still have not succeeded.&quot; A similar notion to the latter is
used in &quot;thin end of the wedge&quot; arguments in ethics. The
construction of a completely general definition of the notion presents
great difficulties, which is why the discussion has been restricted to
<i>one-dimensional</i> respects, although this restriction was
not required for the above definition of &quot;absolutely better in a
respect.&quot; Comparative betterness is defined in two stages: first we
need the idea of approximating to satisfying <i>C</i>, then
the idea of satisfying <i>C</i> to different degrees.

<p>
<b>
(B10)
</b>
The abbreviation &quot;App(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>)&quot; will be used for
statements of the form &quot;For members of <i>Z</i> being <i>P</i>
entails approximating more closely in respect <i>R</i> to satisfying <i>C</i>
in circumstances <i>S</i> than being <i>Q</i> does.&quot; This notion,
like the others, can be defined in purely logical terms, using an idea
suggested by Professor John Kingman.</span><br>

<blockquote>
<i>Definition:</i>
<br>&quot;A <i>relational R-property</i> is a property of the form
&quot;<i>h</i> or <i>R-er</i> than <i>h</i>&quot;
or of the form
&quot;<i>h</i> or <i>less-R</i> than <i>h</i>,&quot; where <i>h</i> is
a property in <i>R</i> and <i>R-er</i> and <i>less-R</i> are the
associated relations of <i>R</i>,
</blockquote>
<p>


If <i>R</i> is the set of heights, and <i>C</i> the condition of being
at least 10 feet high, then we can pick out a subset <i>T</i> of the set
of relational <i>R-</i>properties, such that possession of all
properties of <i>T</i> is necessary for satisfying C, namely, the set of
all properties of the form &quot;<i>h</i> or higher&quot; (i.e.,
&quot;at least as high as <i>h</i>&quot;,
where <i>h</i> ranges over the heights between 0 and 10 feet. Clearly,
among the things which fail to satisfy <i>C</i> (i.e., they are too
short), those which possess more properties in T approximate more
closely to satisfying C. This illustrates the following definition of
approximating more closely:

<blockquote>
<i>Definition:</i>
<br>&quot;App(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>)&quot;
means &quot;For members of <i>Z</i> in circumstances <i>S</i>, being
<i>P</i> entails possessing a more inclusive subset of the properties in
<i>T</i> than being <i>Q</i>, does, though not all the properties in <i>T</i>,
where <i>T</i> is the set of all relational <i>R</i>-properties possession of
which is necessary for members of <i>Z</i> to satisfy <i>C</i> in
circumstances <i>S</i>.&quot;
</blockquote>

The phrase &quot;though not all ...&quot; is intended to rule out the
case of absolute betterness in respect <i>R</i>. Thus, our definition
lays down in effect that being <i>P</i> approximates more closely to satisfying
<i>C</i> than being <i>Q</i> does if and only if things which are <i>P</i> satisfy
more necessary conditions for satisfying <i>C</i>, but not all, though this
last formulation is not sufficiently precise to cover all cases.
Although the definition is applicable only to one-dimensional respects,
a generalization to include multi-dimensional respects which can be
subdivided into one-dimensional respects is clearly possible.
<p>

<b>
(B11)
</b>
We now define &quot;Among members of <i>Z</i>, things which are <i>P</i>
satisfy <i>C</i> to a higher degree in respect <i>R</i> than things which are
<i>Q</i>, in circumstances <i>S</i>,&quot; which we abbreviate as
&quot;Deg(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>),&quot; thus:

<blockquote>
<i>Definition:</i>
<br>
Deg(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>)&quot;
means &quot;App(<i>Q,P,not-C,R,S,Z</i>).&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>

So, satisfying <i>C</i> to a higher degree is the same as approximating
less closely to satisfying <i>not-C</i>. We are now in a position to define
comparative betterness in the obvious way: being comparatively better
with reference to satisfying <i>C</i> amounts to either satisfying <i>C</i> to
a higher degree or approximating more closely to satisfying <i>C.</i>

<p>
These definitions have interesting consequences in connection with
&quot;thin end of the wedge&quot; arguments, and reference conditions
which involve theoretical limiting cases, but there is no space to
explore these consequences here.

<p>
It is important to notice (a) that the definitions are based only on
purely logical concepts (b) that they are sufficiently general to
include respects of comparison which do not involve a
&quot;metric,&quot; i.e., although we require a relation
<i>R-er</i>, we do not require that &quot;<i>R-er</i> by how
much?&quot; make any sense.

<p>

A still more general account of comparative betterness
would make use of the concept of <i>P</i> making satisfaction of <i>C</i> more
probable than <i>Q</i>, does, but the concept of probability is too full of
obscurities to be discussed here. We might perhaps be able to
incorporate this case within the framework of the above definitions by
allowing the respect <i>R</i> to be probability of satisfying <i>C</i>.
(Compare footnote 1 to definition of &quot;Abs-better.&quot;)

 <p>

<b>
(B12)
</b>
We now, at last, define &quot;better,&quot; so that it is
equivalent to &quot;either absolutely or comparatively better,&quot;
thus:

<blockquote>
<i>Definition:</i>
<br>&quot;Better(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>)&quot;
means &quot;Abs-better(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>)
or App(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>)
or Deg(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>).&quot;
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<i>Definition:</i>
<br>
&quot;Worse(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>)&quot;
means &quot;Better(<i>Q,P,C,R,S,Z</i>).&quot;
</blockquote>

This completes the analysis of fundamental comparisons. It is worth
noting that there are at least four distinct ways in which such a
comparison may be false: (i) for members of <i>Z</i> in circumstances
<i>S, R</i> may not be relevant to <i>C</i>, (ii) the properties
<i>P</i> and <i>Q</i> may be exactly similar in respect <i>R</i>,
(iii)
although <i>R</i> is relevant and <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i> differ in respect
<i>R</i>, the
difference may be such that neither is absolutely or comparatively
better (e.g., if <i>C</i> is between 10 and 11 feet long, and
<i>P</i> and
<i>Q</i> are lengths of 9 feet and 12 feet), (iv) finally
&quot;Better(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>)&quot; may be false because
&quot;Worse(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>)&quot; is true, and <i>vice versa</i>.
(Case (iii) is particularly interesting because of the possibility of
replacing the respect <i>R</i> with another respect consisting of the
same properties ordered by a different relation: see end of B6 above.)

<p>
Interesting theorems can be proved from the definitions, such as that
for <i>fixed C, R, S, Z</i>, &quot;Better&quot; determines a transitive
asymmetric relation between P and <i>Q.</i> Further, owing to the manner
in which not-C occurs in the definitions it follows that
Better(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>) if and only if
Better(<i>Q,P,not-C,R,S,Z</i>). i.e., Worse(<i>P,Q,not-C,R,S,Z</i>). It
seems that in view of the possibility of applying various logical
operators to such things as <i>P</i>, <i>Q</i>, <i>C</i> and
<i>S</i>, there is an interesting branch of formal logic waiting to be
developed here.

<i>C. Non-fundamental comparisons</i>
</font>
</h2>
<b>
(C1)
</b>
Having defined &quot;Better&quot; as it occurs in <i>fundamental</i>
comparisons, we can easily extend its use to other forms. For example,
if<i> x</i> and<i> y</i> are particular objects in the range of
significance of <i>C</i>, we can analyze<i></i> &quot;<i>x</i> is better
than <i>y</i> in respect <i>R</i> with reference to
satisfying <i>C</i> in circumstances <i>S</i>,&quot; i.e.,
&quot;Better(<i>x,y,C,R,S</i>)&quot;
thus: &quot;<i>x</i> has property <i>P</i>
in <i>R</i> and <i>y</i> has property <i>Q</i> in <i>R</i>, and
Better(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>) for all classes <i>Z</i> whose members differ
in respect <i>R</i> and in no other respect relevant to <i>C</i> in
circumstances <i>S</i>.&quot; The last clause of this indicates how
&quot;<i>ceteris paribus</i>&quot; clauses can be dealt with in general.

<p>
Similarly, &quot;The<i> R-</i>er the better with reference to satisfying
<i>C</i>, in circumstances <i>S</i>, for members of <i>Z</i>,&quot;
where <i>R-er</i> is an associated relation of a respect <i>R</i>, can
be analyzed as &quot;For any <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> in <i>Z</i>, if
<i>R-</i>er(<i>x,y</i>) then there exist properties <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i>, in <i>R</i>
such that <i>P(x</i>) and <i>Q(y</i>) and
Better(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>).&quot;

<p>
Comparisons mentioning no
circumstances can be derived from fundamental comparisons by quantifying
over <i>all</i> circumstances. Comparisons mentioning no subclass of
comparison can be treated as cases where<i> Z</i> is the whole range of
significance of the condition <i>C</i>. Thus, the logical constant
&quot;Better&quot; defined above can occur in a very wide range of forms
of comparison, with different degrees of complexity, just as the
ordinary word &quot;better&quot; can (even though some of the complexity
is not always made explicit in ordinary English). It is perhaps
surprising that a logicist analysis should define a word so similar to
&quot;better&quot; in some of its ordinary uses, even if there are other
uses which cannot easily be accounted for along these lines.

<p>

<b>
(C2)
</b>
One use not so far accounted for is that in which many comparisons
in different respects are weighed up, giving an answer to &quot;Which is
better on <i>the whole</i>, taking all respects into account?&quot;
Similarly with circumstances <i>S.</i> The problem does not seem to
arise for sub-classes <i>Z</i>, since taking all sub-classes
into account
would appear to amount to letting <i>Z</i> be the class of all things
capable of being compared relative to C, a case mentioned in the
previous paragraph.

<p>

Similarly there is no problem of weighing up all
reference conditions <i>C</i> since no sense can be made of a comparison
with reference to satisfying all conditions. Our problem then is to
define a weighing up operator, applicable to <i>R</i> and to <i>S</i>.
If we represent it as &quot;acc-,&quot; we can read &quot;acc-R&quot;
and &quot;acc-S&quot; as &quot;taking all respects into account&quot;
and &quot;taking all possible circumstances into account,&quot; for
example, in comparisons like
Better(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>)&quot;and &quot;acc-S, acc-R,
Better(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>).&quot;
<p>

Like a quantifier, &quot;acc-&quot; binds the variable to which it is
applied. Clearly if being <i>P</i> is better than being <i>Q</i> in
<i>all</i> respects, or in <i>all</i> circumstances, then it is better
taking all respects, or all circumstances, into account. So we have the
following criterion of adequacy for any definition of
&quot;acc-&quot;:

<blockquote>
(A) &quot;all-&quot; implies &quot;acc-&quot;.
</blockquote>

<p>

But neither our previous definition of &quot;Better&quot; nor this
criterion determines a unique weighing up operation, for dealing with
cases where <i>P</i> is better than Q in some respects, or
circumstances, while <i>Q</i> is better than <i>P</i> in others, with
reference to satisfying condition C.

<p>

<b>
(C3)
</b>
For example, suppose that for a given C, <i>S</i>, and<i> Z</i>,
being <i>P</i> is better in some respects while being<i> Q is</i> better
in others, then all the following methods of taking all respects into
account conform to (A).

<p>

<div class=paragraph style="padding:0pt 50pt 2pt 25pt;
text-align:justify; text-indent:-20pt;">
<span class=font1 style=" line-height:9.7pt;">
(1) Being <i>P</i> is better than being <i>Q</i>, acc<i>-R</i>, if the
former is better in more respects than the latter: here respects are
simply counted.</span><br>
</div>

<div class=paragraph style="padding:0pt 50pt 2pt 25pt;
text-align:justify; text-indent:-20pt;">
<span class=font1 style=" line-height:9.7pt;">
(2) More generally, weight each respect, then add. For example, if the
respects involve measurable differences, then weight each according to
the degree or extent (positive or negative) to which being <i>P is</i>
better than being <i>Q</i> in that respect, with reference to C. E.g.,
one may be <i>much</i> better in respect to speed while the other is
only <i>slightly</i> better in respect to accuracy. In addition the
respects might be weighted according to some measure of their
importance, or some measure of the difficulty or cost of changing things
in each respect. Several different weights may be applied prior to
summation.</span><br>
</div>

<div class=paragraph style="padding:0pt 50pt 2pt 25pt;
text-align:justify; text-indent:-20pt;">
<span class=font1 style=" line-height:9.7pt;">
(3) Ignore all respects in which neither being <i>P</i> nor being Q is
absolutely better than the other (in the sense defined previously),
and then apply weighting and summation only to the remainder,
assuming there is a remainder.</span><br>
</div>

<div class=paragraph style="padding:0pt 50pt 2pt 25pt;
text-align:justify; text-indent:-20pt;">
<span class=font1 style=" line-height:9.8pt;">
(4) Using a measure of degree of betterness in each respect say
<i>P</i> is better on the whole if its minimum degree of betterness
is greater than <i>Q</i>'s<i>.</i> (A &quot;maximin&quot;</span>
method: the better is the one with the largest minimum lead.)</span><br>
</div>

<div class=paragraph style="padding:0pt 50pt 2pt 25pt;
text-align:justify; text-indent:-20pt;">
<span class=font1 style=" line-height:10.0pt;">
(5) Alternatively say <i>P</i> is better on the whole if Q's maximum
degree of betterness is less than P's, (A &quot;minimax&quot; method:
the better is the one with the smallest maximum lag.)</span><br>

<div class=paragraph style="padding:0pt 50pt 2pt 25pt;
text-align:justify; text-indent:-20pt;">
<span class=font1 style=" line-height:10.0pt;">
(6)  Order the respects which are relevant in a series
<i>R1, R2, ...</i>, <i>Rn</i>, e.g., according to
diminishing importance. Then take the <i>first</i> respect in which
<i>P</i> and <i>Q</i>. differ, and say <i>P</i> is better on the whole
if it is better in that respect, ignoring the rest.</span><br>
</div>

<div class=paragraph style="padding:0pt 50pt 2pt 25pt;
text-align:justify; text-indent:-20pt;">
<span class=font1 style=" line-height:9.7pt;">
(7) &quot;Constrained maximization&quot;: specify
&quot;constraints&quot; by choosing subsets from each respect, and
then apply method (6), or one of the others, so long as <i>P</i>
and Q entail possessing properties in the subsets specified, and in
other cases use some other method, or treat them as
non-comparable.</span><br>
</div>


<p>
<b>
(C4)
</b>
Similar methods might be used for weighing up comparisons relative
to all possible states of affairs. Each possible state of affairs which
covers too wide a range of possibilities must first be divided into
sub-ranges such that either <i>P</i> or being Q is definitely better in
each sub-range. If each sub-range <i>is</i> given a measure, positive or
negative according to whether <i>P</i> or <i>Q is</i> better in that
sub-range, then we can use the above weighting and adding (or
integrating) techniques for taking account of all possible states of
affairs. For example, each possibility might be weighted according to
the likelihood of its occurrence, or the likelihood of the reference
condition having to be satisfied in that state of affairs, or according
to the ease or difficulty with which unfavorable aspects of the
circumstances can be removed, or favorable aspects introduced. For
example, if <i>C</i> is the condition of being usable for cutting grass,
then inferiority in circumstances where the grass is covered with snow
may not be important if such circumstances rarely arise, or if snow is
easily removed. Similarly maximin and minimax methods can be
used.

<p>

<b>
(C5)
</b>
This illustrates the wealth of possible ways of applying
&quot;acc-&quot; to <i>R</i> and <i>S.</i> It may in some cases, though
not in others, make a difference whether <i>R</i> is first weighed up
holding <i>S</i> constant and then <i>S</i> weighed up, or vice versa:
but either gives a way of taking both all respects and all circumstances
into account. We have already remarked that neither the criterion (A)
nor our previous definitions (nor, for that matter, the ordinary sense
of &quot;better&quot;) determines which of the many possible methods
should be used.

<p>
It may further be noted that even within each type of
method there is a further element of arbitrariness in the choice of
the various measures used for weighting. E.g., if we are trying to
measure the degree by which one thing is better than another in respect
to speed, with reference to being able to cut grass, one person may want
to use the difference in the number of pounds of grass cut per minute,
while another argues that as speeds get greater differences in speed
matter less, so that the measure should be the difference in speed
divided by the average speed of the two machines. Similarly
arbitrariness enters into the selection of a common measure for
differences in different respects, such as speed and accuracy, as in
method (2).

<p>

These kinds of arbitrariness, to say nothing of the
complexity of the structure of the problem as stated here, are ignored
by those who claim that specifying a function (or purpose) automatically
determines criteria of relative merit in relation to that function:
&quot;better as a means&quot; is thought quite wrongly to be completely
unproblematic, unlike &quot;better as an end.&quot; (Actually the case
is still more complicated with &quot;good.&quot;) The complexity and
arbitrariness go equally unnoticed by those who claim that the job of
politicians (or voters) is to select goals, and the job of civil
servants and social scientists to find the best ways of achieving these
goals.


<p>

<b>
(C6)
</b>
Can this arbitrariness be eliminated? We could, of course, select
one weighing up operation and build it into our definition of
&quot;Better,&quot; or our definition of &quot;acc-,&quot; so that
&quot;Which is better on the whole, with reference to satisfying
C?&quot; always had a single determinate answer. But this restriction
would itself be arbitrary, and would limit the application of our
definitions too much. Alternatively, we could simply require that the
basis of comparison be enlarged to include an additional factor <i>W</i>
(or two factors <i>W<SUB>r</SUB></i> and <i>W<SUB>c</SUB></i>, for
respects and circumstances) which specifies a definite weighing up
method. The question &quot;Which is better <i>on the whole</i>, relative
to <i>B?&quot;</i> would then have a clear sense as long as <i>B</i> was
so enlarged, and comparisons like &quot;Acc-S acc-R,
Better(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z,W</i>)&quot; would have a definite truth-value,
which might depend on which method <i>W</i> was.

<p>

This method of eliminating arbitrariness is no more an undesirable trick
than the specification of the other factors in the basis, since it is
unreasonable to expect the question &quot;Which is better on the
whole?&quot; to have a determinate answer when no weighing up method is
specified. However, it may be that even when no such factor is made
explicit some subtle convention often operates to determine one. For
example, it may be that people never make statements (or perhaps never
make comparisons) without having some purpose or motive in doing so, in
which case the condition of serving this purpose could be used in a
&quot;second-order&quot; basis for comparing different possible
weighting factors. Thus, where a particular weighting method can be
shown to be better than all others, relative to the purpose for which
the original comparison is being made (or the purpose in asking
&quot;Which is better?&quot;), then we could lay down that that is the
method to be used in applying &quot;acc-,&quot; thus creating a subtle
relation between semantics and pragmatics.
(This suggests a need for a
study of higher-order comparisons, i.e., comparisons between bases of
comparison.)

<p>

Alternatively the convention might operate that the
weighting factor should be chosen in accordance with what would serve
the needs of a normal human being who wanted the condition <i>C</i> in
the original basis to be satisfied. (This would, of course, break down
for conditions no normal person would want satisfied!) From the point of
view of our logical analysis, however, it does not matter how a
particular factor comes to be added to the basis: once it is added, our
analysis shows what sense is expressed by comparisons relative to the
new basis.</span><br>


<h2>
<font size="4">
<i>D. Connections with some other meta-ethical theories</i>
</font>
</h2>


<b>
(D1)
</b>
The sense of &quot;Better&quot; in fundamental comparisons of the
form &quot;Better(<i>P,Q,C,R,S,Z</i>)&quot; may be called a <i>logicist</i>
sense, since it is defined in purely logical terms. It is neither a
descriptive relational word, nor an &quot;expressive&quot; word, but a
logical statement-forming operator, applicable to six arguments, P, Q,
C, R, S and Z, and we have seen how it can occur ha other forms of
statements besides fundamental comparisons. Although our definitions do
not lay down any specific descriptive content, i.e., they do not mention
descriptive criteria of betterness, nevertheless such criteria, and thus
descriptive content, are generated by interaction between the meaning of
&quot;Better&quot; and the basis of comparison. Thus comparisons are
able to state objective facts, though usually rather vague facts, since
saying that one thing is better than another relative to <i>B</i> gives
much less information than describing the specific features which make
it better. Hence comparisons entail and are entailed by
straight-forwardly factual or descriptive statements.

<p>
<b>
(D2)
</b>
However, interaction between &quot;better&quot; and the context of
utterance can also generate non-descriptive force. For the reference
condition <i>C may</i> be one which a hearer or the speaker wants,
needs, intends, etc., to have satisfied, even though this possibility
was at no stage presupposed in our analysis of comparisons with fully
explicit basis. If one wants C to be satisfied and is told that <i>x</i>
is better than <i>y</i> in all respects and in all circumstances, with
reference to satisfying C, then this gives one reason for choosing
<i>x</i> rather than <i>y</i>, provided one has no other conflicting
attitudes and no more specific information about <i>x</i> and<i> y.</i>
For one can infer that if <i>y</i> satisfies <i>C</i> then <i>x</i> does
also, but there is a possibility that <i>x</i> does though not<i> y</i>,
hence the choice of <i>y</i> is more likely to frustrate one's want.

<p>

Similarly, if one is told that, with reference to C, <i>x</i> is better
in a certain respect <i>R1, </i> or in circumstances S1, then this gives
one <i>prima facie</i> reason for choosing x rather than<i> y</i>,
though much weaker reason. However, in both examples further information
can cancel the reason, such as the information, although <i>x</i> is
better, neither <i>x</i> nor <i>y</i> satisfies <i>C</i> (or perhaps
both do), or the information that although x is better in respect
<i>R2, y</i> is better in respect <i>R2</i>, with reference to <i>C.</i>
Of course, whether further information cancels the reason<i></i> given
depends on further facts about the person concerned, such as whether he
not merely wants <i>C</i> satisfied but wants it satisfied to the
highest possible degree, or whether he regards a miss as being as good
as a mile. Similar remarks apply to the <i>speaker's</i> commitment to
choosing <i>x</i> rather than <i>y</i> when <i>he</i> wants <i>C</i> to
be satisfied.

<p>

Thus, in certain contexts, we see that statements using
the logicist &quot;Better&quot; may have &quot;action-guiding&quot;
force, or may express advice, recommendation, or preference. Exactly the
same remarks, of course, apply to &quot;Worse,&quot; since whoever wants
not-<i>C</i> to be satisfied has as much reason for choosing the worse
of two things relative to <i>C</i> as one who wants C satisfied has for
choosing the better. What is better with reference to my aims may well
be worse with reference to yours. This brings out a &quot;symmetry&quot;
between &quot;Better&quot; and &quot;Worse.&quot;

<p>


<b>
(D3)
</b>
The non-descriptive force of comparisons so far discussed depends
on someone wanting the condition C or the condition, not-C satisfied,
but this relativity can be removed by existential quantification, for
example in comparisons like the following:

<blockquote>
(i) <i>&quot;x</i> is better than <i>y</i> with reference to some
condition you want satisfied,&quot;
<p>
(ii) <i>&quot;x</i> is better than <i>y</i> with reference to some
condition which everyone wants satisfied at all costs.&quot;
</blockquote>


These have action-guiding force in the direction of choosing the better,
no matter what the wants of the hearer, though in (i) the question of
conflicting wants or purposes is left open, so the force is only
<i>prima facie.</i> However, since no specific reference condition is
mentioned, there is no risk of some hearers not wanting it satisfied, so
in neither case can some hearers claim to be given reason for choosing
the worse, (A similar use of existential quantification can remove the
relativity to evidence otherwise inherent in &quot;<i>p</i> is
probable.&quot;)
<p>


<b>
(D4)
</b>
We can now see how people who started off using the logicist
concept &quot;Better&quot; as defined above, might, in time, come to
use the word &quot;Better&quot; with a different sense, in certain
contexts. For example, it might become customary to leave out
phrases like &quot;with reference to some condition which you want
satisfied,&quot; the existential implication being taken for granted
when no reference condition was mentioned. Then &quot;this is better
than that&quot; would* always give <i>prima facie</i> reason for
choosing this rather than that, as explained above.

<p>
In time, this action-guiding force would come to be associated directly
with &quot;Better,&quot; so that it acquired a new meaning and could be
used intelligibly in non-descriptive speech acts without any reference
to a basis of comparison, explicit or implicit. Of course, no true or
false proposition could then be expressed, and there would be nothing
for &quot;Better&quot; to interact with to generate descriptive criteria
of betterness,
though this issue would be likely to be confused by
lingering associations with the previous descriptive use. The new use,
or uses, would conform more closely to an emotivist, attitudinist, or
prescriptivist analysis, and some philosophers would regard this kind of
meaning as central or in some sense primary, even if the other
descriptive use continued (e.g., where the reference condition was made
explicit), owing to the difficulty of thinking of any other way of
explaining how &quot;Better&quot; could occur in such a  wide range of
contexts without changing its meaning.

<p>

Failing to think of the logicist
analysis, they might even say that <i>x</i> is better than <i>y</i> with
reference to satisfying C&quot; expressed a hypothetical commitment
or prescription, to choose <i>x</i> rather than
<i>y</i> if one wanted <i>C</i> satisfied, other things being
equal. Apparent logical relations (e,g., entailment) between
descriptive statements and these hypothetical commissives would be
explained away as being due to the &quot;logical oddness&quot; of not
choosing what satisfies one's acknowledged desires. Perhaps
something like this little story has already happened in reality?

<p>
<b>
(D5)
</b>
Another illuminating possibility is that in a (primitive?) society
where the logicist concept &quot;Better&quot; was used, it might become
customary for certain commonly used reference conditions to be left
unstated, for example being conducive to the general happiness, or being
in accordance with the will of God, or the King. In time such a basis
would seem to be redundant: it would already be part of the meaning of
&quot;Better&quot; to refer to the standard basis, unless
otherwise qualified.

<p>

Another, more subtle, possibility is that some
specific weighing-up method (e.g., one referring to conduciveness to
normal human aims) might always be used for weighing up different
respects and circumstances, in cases where things were being compared
neither of which was better in all respects or in all circumstances,
with reference to <i>C</i>. This too might lead to the feeling that this
weighting factor was somehow part of the meaning of &quot;Better,&quot;
except, perhaps, where an explicit qualification cancelled this
implication. In both cases, we should have a use of &quot;Better&quot;
in which reference to a particular basis, or part of a basis, was part
of its <i>meaning</i>, and not just a consequence of the interaction
between its meaning and the context: in this use the basis would be
&quot;ossified.&quot; Concentration on examples of this use would lead
some philosophers to put forward naturalistic analyses of
&quot;better&quot; in terms of descriptive criteria for betterness.

<p>
To such philosophers the use where an explicit basis implied different
non-standard criteria of betterness (e.g., &quot;This is a much better
poison for killing old ladies quickly without leaving traces&quot;)
would be inexplicable, as would non-descriptive uses of the sorts
referred to previously.


<p>
<b>
(D6)
</b>
Prescriptive and descriptive uses of &quot;better&quot; and other
evaluative words, though easily intelligible in their own right, seem to
be given a new unity by being accounted for as derived from the logicist
use, even if there is no historical accuracy in the above stories about
alterations in the meaning of &quot;Better.&quot; However, there is a
type of use which is not so easy to understand in its own right, and is
not so easy to explain away: the type of use illustrated by &quot;This
just <i>is</i> better (good, right, wrong, etc.), not merely in relation
to <U>this</U> or that purpose or aim or end.&quot; Of course,
<i>some</i> such uses can be given a non-assertive analysis, but
occasionally people do mean to assert something with this form of words.

<p>

I believe that this, like many metaphysical uses of language, has to be
explained in terms of the extrapolation of perfectly sound concepts into
contexts which subtly undermine the presuppositions of their use, in
such a way that although something is said which has a kind of meaning,
it is nevertheless fundamentally confused and incapable of being true or
false. This is similar to the mistake of trying to make non-relative
statements about movement or spatial position, a mistake which is by no
means <i>trivial</i>, as the history of science shows. (E.g.,
&quot;This<i></i> can move, <i>that</i> can move, and so can that and
that .... surely it is possible for <i>everything</i> to move?&quot;)
Analogously people might somehow come to believe that there is an
&quot;ultimate&quot; basis of comparison, in some way more fundamental
than all others, relative to which all others can be compared. This
belief, however confused, gives sense, of a sort, to comparisons
relative to an absolute basis, and accounts for uses of
&quot;better&quot; which do not fit into emotivist, prescriptivist, or
crude naturalist moulds.


<p>
An intrinsic, or absolute, use of
&quot;better&quot; then can be thought of as a &quot;secondary
sense&quot; of the logicist use.[2] This topic really needs
more discussion than there is space for here.

<p>
<b>
(D7)
</b>
It should be clear from the above discussion that no claim is made
that all uses of &quot;better&quot; con conform form to the definition
in purely logical terms. In fact, the set of ordinary uses seems to be a
mixture of <i>at least</i> four things (a) the logicist use, (b) the
non-descriptive uses discussed by emotivists and prescriptivists, where
there is no basis of comparison, (c) &quot;crude naturalistic&quot; uses
where a particular basis (or part of a basis) has become part of the
meaning of &quot;better&quot; and (d) the metaphysical or absolute use
based on belief in an absolute frame of reference.

<p>

Of course, there are various uses which can be derived from the logicist
use by making minor modifications in the definition, as where it is
implied that &quot;a miss is as good as a mile.&quot; (This is not
always implied, e.g., in &quot;Your aim is getting better even though
you still cannot hit the target&quot;!) Further, even when the use of
&quot;better&quot; does conform to the logicist pattern this may be
obscured by the use of indirect means of indicating the precise basis of
comparison, as in the clock example in B3, and in some cases the
basis actually used may not divide up into <i>C</i>, <i>R</i>, <i>S</i>,
and <i>Z</i> in a unique way. Despite all this, the logicist concept is
an illuminating idealization, as I have tried to show. It might even be
argued that an explicit attempt to stick to the logicist concept would
make much moral and political controversy more tractable, to say nothing
of the added clarity that might be given to consumer guides.


<p>
Quite apart from questions of practical applications, the above analysis
may shed new light on some philosophical problems not so far mentioned.
For example, one of the many problems of induction can be formulated as
&quot;What makes some predictive policies better than others?,&quot; and
I have already hinted at some ways of clarifying this question in the
latter half of [3]. A related application would be the replacement of
subjective utility scales in Games Theory and Decision Theory with an
order of merit objectively determined by a basis of comparison.
Returning to moral philosophy, it seems to be possible to clarify the
meaning of &quot;ought&quot; by starting from statements of the form
&quot;It ought to be the case that <i>p&quot;</i> and analyzing these
(in some cases) as being elliptical
for &quot;Relative to the basis <i>B</i>,
p is (or would be) better than
other members of the class of possible states of affairs <i>Z</i>.&quot;

<p>
The relation between
&quot;good&quot; and &quot;better&quot; is somewhat more complicated,
and involves elements of extreme vagueness, but is also worth exploring.
Finally, it should be possible to shed new light on the problem of the
nature of moral judgments by discussing what makes a basis of comparison
a moral one. These and other developments will have to wait for another
occasion.
